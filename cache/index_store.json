ABSTRACT\r\nIncident Response Planning (IRP1) is essential for effective\r\ncybersecurity  management,  requiring  detailed  documentation\r\n(orplaybooks)  to  guide  security  personnel  during  incidents. Yet,  creating  comprehensive  IRPs  is  often  hindered  by  chal-\r\nlenges  such  as  complex  systems,  high  turnover  rates,  and\r\nlegacy technologies lacking documentation. This paper argues\r\nthat,  despite  these  obstacles,  the  development,  review,  and\r\nrefinement of IRPs can be significantly enhanced through the\r\nutilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By  leveraging  LLMs  for  tasks  such  as  drafting  initial  plans,\r\nsuggesting best practices, and identifying documentation gaps,\r\norganizations can overcome resource constraints and improve\r\ntheir  readiness  for  cybersecurity  incidents. We  discuss  the\r\npotential  of  LLMs  to  streamline  IRP  processes,  while  also\r\nconsidering the limitations and the need for human oversight in\r\nensuring the accuracy and relevance of generated content. Our\r\nfindings contribute to the cybersecurity field by demonstrating\r\na  novel  approach  to  enhancing  IRP  with  AI  technologies,\r\noffering practical insights for organizations seeking to bolster\r\ntheir incident response capabilities. II. INTRODUCTION\r\nIn an era where digital threats evolve with increasing sophis-\r\ntication, the need for robust (cybersecurity) Incident Response\r\nPlans  (IRPs)  and  appropriate  Standard  Operating  Procedures\r\n(SOPs) has never been more critical. Incident Response Plans\r\nare the broad outline of what an organization may need to do\r\nto recover from various failures such as a malware infestation. An  SOP  is  a  guide  to  the  actual  steps  needed  to  achieve\r\ncertain  outcomes  for  the  given  organization  (e.g.,  secure  an\r\naccount,  isolate  equipment  from  the  network).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YOWdiqF/TH8BlHHwcAAlefSk1pG37sQ1sAghOgdNJvc="},"a33ded67-13df-40a4-820b-5eed745d0f03":{"id_":"a33ded67-13df-40a4-820b-5eed745d0f03","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"fGTARv5xgyaC9h6l5cjSLcSxNWoGgUrEV/pBFAE7+TQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f62d88b9-30fc-42c0-ada5-ff431df639d7","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"YOWdiqF/TH8BlHHwcAAlefSk1pG37sQ1sAghOgdNJvc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"02412a13-5443-4076-8bea-483dab2f9f1f","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf","file_name":"Employing LLMs for Incident Response Planning and Review.pdf"},"hash":"iOM9zvN2Aa4fRqGyfcrpoIv7NcAjuhFqyAHpD+in2hM="}},"text":"The  NIST\r\nContingency Planning Guide and the Computer Security Inci-\r\ndent Handling Guide [5] [1] provide foundational frameworks\r\nfor addressing cyber incidents, emphasizing the necessity for\r\nsecurity  teams  to  be  well-prepared  to  mitigate  and  recover\r\nfrom  attacks.

The recovery process involves\r\nrestoring  systems  or  devices  to  their  normal  functions\r\nand  monitoring  to  ensure  the  incident  has  been  fully\r\nresolved [1]. 4)Post-Incident Activity:Conduct  a  post-incident  review\r\nto learn from the incident, prevent future occurrences, and\r\nimprove  the  organization’s  incident  response  capability.

If any\r\nof  the  conditions  in  that  conjunction  become  false,  then  the\r\nIRP instructions become worse-than-useless because they are\r\nnow misleading rather than just missing.

Simplistic IRP-SOP Relationship\r\nAn IRP is typically a larger-scale undertaking which includes\r\nmanagement and is often built with input from across depart-\r\nments. The  disconnect  happens  in  the  area  where  high-level\r\nIRP directions (“disconnect the computer from the network”)\r\nmeet real-world application (“log into tool X with an account\r\nhaving  security-controller  rights,  find  the  device  in  question,\r\nright-click [...]”). It  is  not  uncommon  for  companies  to  either  a)  not  have\r\nSOPs at all or b) for them to be out of date. In these scenarios,\r\nthere  is  an  implicit  trust  that  the  current  staff  will  be  able\r\nto  handle  whatever  challenges  come  their  way. This  is  often\r\nthe  case,  but  in  situations  of  high-stress  such  as  an  incident\r\nresponse event, time is usually a factor and optimizing for the\r\ncorrect execution is critical.

Some  of\r\nthese insights may be directly actionable, while others might\r\nbe  disregarded  based  on  their  applicability  to  the  specific\r\ncontext. 1)  Effective Context Setting:\r\n•Contextualizing  Prompts:To  achieve  more  targeted  out-puts from LLMs, it is essential to contextualize prompts\r\neffectively.

To mitigate or eliminate bike-shedding in incident response\r\nplanning  and  ensure  that  the  work  remains  of  high  value\r\nand  relevance,  LLMs  can  assist  by  prioritizing  through  gap\r\nanalysis. Specifically,  an  LLM  can  analyze  a  list  of  existing\r\nSOPs alongside names of forthcoming candidate SOPs to help\r\nidentify  those  of  the  highest  value  in  the  near  term. This\r\nassessment is not limited to a technical perspective but extends\r\nto  regulatory  and  compliance  considerations  as  well.

By  integrating  LLMs  into  the  process  of  developing  and\r\nmaintaining IRPs and SOPs, organizations can ensure that their\r\nincident response planning is not only relevant and compliant\r\nbut also adaptable to the evolving cybersecurity landscape. E. Time-bound\r\nThe cybersecurity landscape ever changing, and new threats\r\nand  vulnerabilities  are  constant  as  are  techniques  and  tactics\r\nused  by  threat  actors. In  this  context,  the  swift  identification\r\nand  development  of  IRPs  and  SOPs  for  new  scenarios  and\r\nnew technologies is absolutely critical. Strong SOPs should be\r\nbroadly applicable and reusable, but as unexpected responses\r\nare  needed,  an  SOP  supported  by  deep  analysis  should  be\r\nwritten  (e.g.,  an  SOP  for  disconnecting  a  campus  from  the\r\nInternet). This  section  explores  the  criticality  of  setting  and\r\nadhering to time-bound objectives in crafting IRPs and SOPs,\r\nwith a focus on leveraging LLMs to streamline this process. 1)  Setting  Realistic  Timelines:A  thorough  assessment  of\r\nan  organization’s  existing  incident  response  capabilities  and\r\nresources  lays  the  groundwork  for  realistic  timeline  setting. Understanding the starting point is essential for accurate plan-\r\nning and expectation management.

This helps identify antecedent tasks that may\r\nbe needed before those under consideration can be built. LLMs  can  dramatically  reduce  the  time  required  to  draft\r\ncomprehensive  IRPs  and  SOPs. By  inputting  organizational\r\nspecifics  and  compliance  requirements,  LLMs  can  generate\r\ninitial  drafts  that  teams  can  refine,  significantly  accelerating\r\nthe development process. 2)  Incorporating Time-bound Goals into IRP/SOP Develop-\r\nment:Establishing specific milestones within the IRP and SOP\r\ndevelopment  process  is  crucial. For  instance,  completing  the\r\ndraft of an IRP within four weeks or finalizing a set of SOPs by\r\nthe end of the quarter provides clear targets for the team to aim\r\nfor. Furthermore, allocating time for feedback and revisions is\r\nessential for an iterative approach aiming to optimize the plan. Setting clear deadlines for each review phase ensures that the\r\ndevelopment  process  remains  on  track,  allowing  for  iterative\r\nimprovements without derailing the overall timeline. The unexpected can occur in the security space, which may\r\nnegatively impact the timeline. To reduce the risk of missing\r\na deadline due to unplanned higher-priority tasks, scheduling\r\nregular  progress  reviews  helps  monitor  the  advancement  of\r\nIRP  and  SOP  development  against  the  established  timeline.

Arguably, those who can learn from \r\nsecurity incidents and address the underlying causes will reduce the prevalence of similar ones in the \r\nfuture. This research provides a new examination of how organisations learn from incidents by systemat- \r\nically reviewing academic research on organisational learning from cyber security incidents and identify- \r\ning further research needed in this area. To do this, it considers three research questions: what research \r\nhas been conducted on learning from cyber security incidents, what learning practices in organisations \r\nhave been found by research and what improvements have been recommended, and what further re- \r\nsearch is needed as organisations learn from such incidents. Using the PRISMA method, a total of 3,986 \r\narticles were extracted and, from these, a relevant set of 30 were selected for analysis to map the body of \r\nresearch, and to identify future research avenues. Despite learning lessons being recommended by both \r\nresearchers and industry standards, our findings suggest that this advice is not being fully adopted by \r\norganisations. Importantly, these studies have found inadequate participation in learning activities, with \r\nsuperficial causal investigations, scarce effort on ensuring lessons are implemented and no evaluation of \r\nwhether the actions taken actually reduce future security incidents. More research is needed to under- \r\nstand the right level and which learning practices to invest in for the greatest impact. For practitioners, \r\nthis review discusses the essential elements of an effective process to learn from incidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TbV1hlUaq/PH4G3EoSvQ0DQveCJ39J/Fl0xfql/m19A="},"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012":{"id_":"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"/gxIeHIrAsiJGhtH3ma7k11UbJrn/CPStDKIax1GoaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a74a9fff-494e-4468-bab1-aae7e4219a4b","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"TbV1hlUaq/PH4G3EoSvQ0DQveCJ39J/Fl0xfql/m19A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"QDx3wKSuOYqbq66BuqHJZN8Xe/okXfDACyNCwavGMFg="}},"text":"For practitioners, \r\nthis review discusses the essential elements of an effective process to learn from incidents.

Introduction \r\nThe rapid digitalisation of our society has created complex webs \r\nof interwoven and interdependent systems across commerce, ed- \r\nucation, health and governments ( World Economic Forum, 2022 ). Recent headlines about vulnerabilities in software such as Solar \r\nWinds, Kaseya and Log4j have heightened organisations’ aware- \r\nness of their dependence on suppliers and the intricate nesting \r\nof software within their systems ( Tuttle, 2022 ). These risks are in- \r\ncreasingly being exploited by financially motivated criminal enter- \r\nprises and by state-sponsored actors to leverage political influence \r\nor cause disruption ( Connolly and Wall, Nov. 2019 ). Despite an ex- \r\npected spend of $170 billion on investment in security and risk \r\nmanagement in 2022 ( Moore, Oct. 13, 2022 ), the number and im- \r\npact of incidents continues to grow. Statistics on the rate of inci- \r\ndents are fraught with challenges around definitions and most re- \r\n∗Corresponding author. E-mail address: cmp54@kent.ac.uk (C.M.

However, in one of the few independent reports, the UK \r\ngovernment’s 2022 survey of 1200 businesses and charities found \r\naround half had experienced at least one cyber security incident in \r\nthe past year (72% if phishing incidents are included) (NCSC, 2022) . Unfortunately, it is essential for today’s organisations to ac- \r\nknowledge that incidents will occur, and they need to be pre- \r\npared to respond and then learn from them. In addition to the \r\nrise in incidents, many organisations now face more security regu- \r\nlations, higher consumer expectations and new reporting require- \r\nments related to data privacy and infrastructure resilience.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VEK6foVVIgl8zbhXc95LXb/bdp2ZFQReqQD6irOqVIw="},"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56":{"id_":"a91edb6c-bbbd-4340-a6d1-1d9e71c1ba56","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"/gxIeHIrAsiJGhtH3ma7k11UbJrn/CPStDKIax1GoaM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bef17a02-9a21-4a0c-8a00-55a392ebe012","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"VEK6foVVIgl8zbhXc95LXb/bdp2ZFQReqQD6irOqVIw="}},"text":"There- \r\nfore, to address the increased incident risks they cannot just work \r\nharder particularly as many face a shortage of cyber security skills \r\n( de Zan, 2019 ).

Many studies have been conducted into organisational learning \r\nand although the literature has been summarised ( Fiol and \r\nLyles, 1985 ; Huber, 1991 ; Easterby-Smith and Lyles, 2012 ; \r\nArgote, 2013 ) there is no generally accepted definition. Argote (2013) described it as a change in the organisation’s \r\nknowledge as a function of experience. Fiol and Lyles (1985) in \r\ntheir definition of organisational learning include translating this \r\nnew knowledge into actions taken by the organisation. Argote and \r\nOphir (2017) refer to it as a process where changes are made as \r\na result of experiences. The research into general organisational \r\nlearning is vast and much of it has focused on using knowlege \r\nto improve the productivity or competitiveness of organisations \r\n(for example, Peter Senge’s popular 1990 business book The \r\nFifth Discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization \r\n( Senge, 2010 )) or, it has focused on enhancing skills and emergent \r\nteam learning ( Argote and Levine, 2017 ). Rather than an extensive \r\nreview of the theories of organisational learning in this paper, we \r\nhave sought to leverage existing models which fit our research \r\nfocus. To understand learning from cyber security incidents, we \r\nneeded to look at research into how organisations intentionally \r\nidentified and implemented lessons learned from incidents. Re- \r\nsearch into how organisations learn specifically from incidents has \r\nbeen focused in the safety discipline, with prominent studies into \r\npublic disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon Macondo oil rig, \r\nthe Challenger space shuttle and the Fukushima nuclear power \r\nplant ( Swuste et al., 2020 ). Safety has a more established field of research into learn- \r\ning from incidents with many years of research exploring how \r\nto reduce the number and impact of incidents ( Le Coze, 2013 ; \r\nJaatun et al., 2009 ). It shares many similarities with cyber se- \r\ncurity as they both seek to reduce the risk of incidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h16j1fnql8nwNvCGVA93eLahGs2DdbwpwNQk3ZBbx4k="},"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678":{"id_":"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OGB+1FwZ5s9aIu5Pp/JkAAjexxmWlIxEL5QKaDyrSSk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8faf78ea-c737-49e6-aaeb-0e10c59e4217","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"h16j1fnql8nwNvCGVA93eLahGs2DdbwpwNQk3ZBbx4k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"+gmuNWXK6B0blWVmdPMv8k4dyaM4E6pSJ7UXRFnNqrs="}},"text":"Evans \r\net al. ( Evans et al., 2019 ) recognised the value of applying the \r\ntechniques developed in the safety field to understand human \r\nreliability causes of safety incidents applied to security inci- \r\ndents. Similarly, other authors ( Kaur et al., 2021 ; Murphy et al., \r\n2021 ; Brostoff and Sasse, 2001 ) have commented that cyber se- \r\ncurity can learn from safety science research particularly in how \r\nto address human causes of incidents. There is an opportunity \r\nto borrow concepts from research on learning from safety inci- \r\ndents to advance the field of cyber security ( Line and Albrecht- \r\nsen, 2016 ). Murphy et al. (2021) defined three interconnected \r\nforms of learning from incidents, firstly at the individual level and \r\nthen at both the formal and informal organisational learning lev- \r\nels. Schilling and Kluge (2009) also modelled learning at distinct \r\nlevels, from the individual to organisational level. Individual learn- \r\ning is part of the process, but for an organisation to learn, it needs \r\nto go beyond and include shared knowledge interpreted in an or- \r\nganisational way ( Curado, 2006 ). This systematic literature review (SLR) will focus on formal \r\nlearning at the organisational level from cyber security incidents, \r\nas our focus is on the changes to systems, procedures and technol- \r\nogy as a result of an incident. This review exclusively covers cyber \r\nsecurity incidents, rather than generic IT incidents such as hard- \r\nware failures and performance issues. The objective is to help or- \r\nganisations improve their overall security posture by understand- \r\ning and addressing the complex causes of incidents. Therefore, this \r\nreview analyses how organisations learn post-incident rather than \r\nlearning in real time during incident response. For transparency, it \r\nexcludes; operational technology, including industrial control sys- \r\ntems or home devices, digital forensics techniques and national se- \r\ncurity or warfare. Shedden et al. (2010) reviewed the literature available in 2010 \r\nto understand how organisational learning research could be ap- \r\nplied to security incident response. At the time there had been \r\nscant research into how organisations learn from cyber security \r\nincidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hbnOB/ljkxg61E/gNnNgijdZqRtieIfHV4YwPsvsAUM="},"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce":{"id_":"eb5f7b39-ee1e-46af-921e-d33a61663bce","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OGB+1FwZ5s9aIu5Pp/JkAAjexxmWlIxEL5QKaDyrSSk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6334b2d3-6ec3-418a-8099-6e024b18b678","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"hbnOB/ljkxg61E/gNnNgijdZqRtieIfHV4YwPsvsAUM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ee4e00aa-a853-48d6-a7b2-b87c40e8c21e","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"y6U6JKcU8xsquHG7HOsXCfrxP1YKkArJUkle8+Xuc8Q="}},"text":"More recent literature reviews have studied the com- \r\nplete security incident management process and, whilst also par- \r\ntially covering learning briefly, they do not cover the topic in depth \r\n( Line and Albrechtsen 2016 ; Grispos et al., 2014 ; Horne et al., \r\n2020 ). In our SLR we address this gap by building upon previous \r\nresearch to provide an up-to-date overview of the literature fo- \r\ncused specifically on learning from incidents. From this analysis we \r\nidentified many areas of learning from security incidents, which \r\nremain unstudied which we used to highlight future research av- \r\nenues. This SLR presents a critical review of the academic literature \r\non learning from incidents and proposes an agenda for further re- \r\nsearch. It enables academics to explore these research gaps and \r\nit allows practitioners to consider opportunities for improvements. By contributing to the knowledge of how to improve the resilience \r\nof organisations against security incidents, this research aims to \r\nhelp reduce the security risks society faces from its dependence \r\non technology. To do this, it addresses the following research ques- \r\ntions (RQs): \r\n(1) What research has been conducted on learning from cyber \r\nsecurity incidents? (2) What learning practices in organisations have been found by \r\nresearch and what improvements have been recommended? (3) What further research is needed in organisational learning \r\nfrom incidents? The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section \r\n2 we present the research method used in this study. The results \r\noutlining existing research are detailed in Section 3 while Section \r\n4 discusses the organisational learning practices found by research \r\nand the gaps identified from our systematic search of the litera- \r\nture to explore future research opportunities and provide future \r\nresearch questions. In this section we also outline the practical im- \r\nplications of this work and the limitations. Finally, in Section 5 we \r\nconclude by summarising the insights of our work for security re- \r\nsearchers and practitioners. 2. Research method \r\n2.1.

PRISMA is now a common technique used in cyber security \r\nresearch ( Uchendu et al., 2021 ; Khan et al., 2022 ). The search terms used were refined iteratively. We began with \r\nterms which naturally link to the topic (‘security incident’ and \r\n‘learning’), then refined these search terms according to the results. This refinement was also guided by a set of gold standard papers \r\non the topic (i.e., those on our exact topic area) which were dis- \r\ncovered early on in our search. An example of a search refinement \r\nwas as follows: the term ‘learning’ returns many results related \r\nto machine learning rather than organisational learning; therefore, \r\nterms such as ‘organisational learning’ and ‘lessons learned’ were \r\nused. After this refinement process, the final search string was de- \r\nfined, which combined several critical search terms: (“security in- \r\ncident” OR “incident response” OR CSIRT 1 ) AND (“organisational \r\n1 Cyber Security Incident Response Team \r\n2","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"y6U6JKcU8xsquHG7HOsXCfrxP1YKkArJUkle8+Xuc8Q="},"77a77ed4-e970-4022-8b7b-e9b565aa9b47":{"id_":"77a77ed4-e970-4022-8b7b-e9b565aa9b47","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"3KY76ywH1ALTuqY4QTvBacXD94SEQpghUzAJiHlSwL4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9fc1cc33-25a2-4ad3-ae60-f692c211ce0d","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"AxHzPGpG4ZnAxBwwwUZTDzFRwL4v+IIp/e4sbL671Gk="}},"text":"C.M.

To present an overview of \r\nthe types of research conducted and published in this area, the se- \r\nlected articles were analysed by original publication details and by \r\nthe research methods used. To understand how researchers have \r\nassessed the learning practices for cyber security incidents, we re- \r\nviewed the foundation they used to frame their studies. To analyse which cyber security learning incident practices the \r\nstudies had covered we looked at how other researchers had de- \r\nscribed the practices of learning from incidents. We found those \r\nwhich were most relevant to learning from cyber security inci- \r\ndents were studies into learning from safety incidents ( Littlejohn \r\net al., 2017 ; ESReDA, 2015 ; Vastveit et al., 2015 ; Drupsteen et al., \r\n2013 ). These practices are also applicable to learning from cyber \r\nsecurity incidents due to the similarities between safety and secu- \r\nrity recognised by several authors ( Kaur et al., 2021 ; Cockram and \r\nLautieri, 2007 ; Kriaa et al., 2015 ; Lisova et al., 2019 ). There have been a range of models used within safety research \r\naligned to the different angles from which the topic has been stud- \r\nied ( Le Coze, 2013 ). Murphy et al. (2021) analysed learning from \r\nsafety incidents using the 3-P model of workplace learning. This \r\nhas three phases: presage, process and product. Their study was \r\nfocused on the perspective of the frontline worker. In contrast, \r\nLe Coze (2013) in his overview of research into learning from safety \r\nincidents used a broad framework covering: industry, countries na- \r\ntions, actors, intensity of event, disciplines and steps.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ISAN0XRPb/bFf8dxFFDtiUyw42pFWJ8Zc/Fo9yHeecM="},"4353fcd6-2861-48ba-a86b-9cfd998e1dac":{"id_":"4353fcd6-2861-48ba-a86b-9cfd998e1dac","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"3KY76ywH1ALTuqY4QTvBacXD94SEQpghUzAJiHlSwL4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0168d3d7-a6b1-41e5-9e9c-405041f21bfa","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"ISAN0XRPb/bFf8dxFFDtiUyw42pFWJ8Zc/Fo9yHeecM="}},"text":"It is the steps \r\nelement which is more relevant for this study as it includes the \r\nlearning activities; reporting, selection, investigation, dissemination \r\nand prevention.

Lukic et al. (2012) also developed a framework for learning \r\nfrom safety incidents based on the literature and validated the \r\nmodel at two organisations. Littlejohn et al.

They \r\nalso looked at the learning process through the context, partic- \r\nipants, type of incident and knowledge.

(2013) studies \r\nto include the end-to-end process, as these two studies provided \r\nthe most comprehensive analysis of the learning process activities \r\norganisations can perform. To provide more insight into the coverage of the research for \r\ncyber security, the interventions or actions step was split into two \r\nparts: incident response improvements and overall security im- \r\nprovements. This was to distinguish studies that only covered im- \r\nprovements to an organisation’s incident response capability, from \r\nthose which also studied how lessons led to changes in the wider \r\nsecurity posture. This created five categories; participation in the \r\nlearning process, causal analysis, incident response improvements, \r\noverall security improvements, and evaluation of the learning pro- \r\ncess. Participation in the learning process includes how the learn- \r\ning might be organised and the involvement of different areas of \r\nthe organisation. Causal analysis includes reporting incidents, cat- \r\negorising incidents and analysing the causes. Both these improve- \r\nment categories include determining and prioritising actions, allo- \r\ncating accountability, dedicating resources and tracking the actions \r\nto completion. The participation of different teams and the learn- \r\ning approach taken will impact the breadth of causes considered \r\nand the causes found will impact the improvements made. How \r\nthese are implemented can impact the security of the organisation. The final learning evaluation phase includes ensuring that actions \r\nare taken, as well as confirming that the action actually enabled \r\nthe anticipated improvement. It also evaluates how well the or- \r\nganisation is learning from incidents. Insights from this phase help \r\nan organisation to improve its learning process. A poor learning \r\nprocess would be evident through recurrence of incidents which \r\nhave similar causes or similar impacts and the organisation has not \r\nadapted its protection, detection and response capabilities. The phases of the learning process set out in Fig. 1 were used to \r\ncollect the data in Table 2 using a deductive approach to examine \r\nand describe the coverage of learning. 3.

There has been a continued \r\nlevel of interest in the topic; as illustrated in Fig. 3 . The most com- \r\nmon publication venue was the Computers & Security journal with \r\nfour studies published on the topic but, overall, there was a wide \r\nrange of venues (for example, the International Journal of Informa- \r\ntion Management and Hawaii International Conference on System \r\nSciences).

In ad- \r\ndition, few concentrated specifically on learning and the majority \r\nonly commented on the lessons learned as a small part of a wider \r\nstudy. Considering the pace of change in cyber security, there is \r\nthe need for more recent research specifically focusing on learning \r\nfrom incidents. 3.2. Research foundations \r\nTo gain insight into how researchers had designed their studies, \r\nwe analysed the foundations used to frame the research. Table 5 \r\nshows safety research was the most common foundation applied \r\nto frame existing studies. Management science was the next most \r\ncommon research foundation others made use of IT standards to \r\nstructure their research and some have applied constructs from \r\nsoftware engineering, with a few adopting psychology approaches. Both ISO/IEC 27035 and NIST 800–61 have frequently been \r\nutilised within our selected studies: ISO/IEC 27035 ( Line et al., \r\n2006 ; Line, 2013 ; Line et al., 2016 ; Jaatun et al., 2016 ; \r\nBartnes et al., 2016 ) and NIST 800–61 ( Grispos et al., 2015 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2020 ). As they have learning as part of their end- \r\nto-end processes, this has encouraged studies to gather informa- \r\ntion on this step. For example, Grispos et al. (2015) conducted a \r\ncase study in a global Fortune 500 financial organisation in the \r\nUK, which included an exploratory set of interviews using the NIST \r\n800–61 phases as a framework to present the Security Incident \r\nResponse Criteria (SIRC), which can be employed to evaluate cyber \r\nsecurity incident response solutions. 6","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vCLlIRTEDi94L61nB6rKdjHHEqWGo6pqaq8jdj+xJX0="},"8bf10487-493a-42df-bcae-5a73ceafdf57":{"id_":"8bf10487-493a-42df-bcae-5a73ceafdf57","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"V0DjbtG/1Z/fpQJ6BgspW54a3PBM5nZ6aUbXwPFFias="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e8a0a88e-e2f6-4ffb-8be2-5a70e23aa1f3","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"HUxRGMvrQOmNWoIWo0c704UcXFnVW0UDMALOu0KCB5E="}},"text":"C.M.

His research at the \r\ntime found that people in organisations were encouraged to learn \r\nas long as they did not question the “fundamental design, goals \r\nand activities of their organisations”, which is single-loop learning. Double-loop learning is used to understand not only the governing \r\nvariables that led to the immediate obvious consequences, but also \r\nto dig deeper to understand what factors may have contributed to \r\nor enabled the incident, see Fig. 4 . In a cyber security context, sin- \r\ngle loop learning would be indentifying the cause of an incident, \r\nsuch as an unpatched software package, and taking an action, such \r\nas to apply the patch. Double loop learning would be questioning \r\nthe governing variables which prevented the timely patching. Ad- \r\ndressing these underlying factors would reduce the likelihood of \r\nrecurring problems, such as of any software remaining unpatched \r\nin the future. The double-loop model has been applied to learning \r\nfrom incidents in studies included in our selection ( Shedden et al., \r\n2010 ; Shedden et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., \r\n2020 ). For example, Ahmad et al.’s (2012) study builds on a model \r\nfrom safety incidents Cooke (2003) and is inspired by double-loop \r\nmodel, to develop a model of a cyber security incident learning \r\nsystem. This double-loop learning theme is continued in a subsequent \r\nstudy by Ahmad et al. (2015) which uses the 4I (intuiting, in- \r\nterpreting, integrating, institutionalizing) organisational learning \r\nframework, building on work by Zietsma ( Zietsma et al., 2002 ) \r\nin management science. One of the reasons this model was se- \r\nlected was its use of double-loop learning principles enabling the \r\nchallenge of an organisations’ norms. The model has three lay- \r\ners that cover stakeholders, learning processes, and learning activ- \r\nities that embed learning within the organisation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IvVyeDOIO+waCDA+SztEuHF2D6M1C+5Rm31NE6QrbIs="},"3c0cee90-64ae-4462-8334-b7b36cf117e7":{"id_":"3c0cee90-64ae-4462-8334-b7b36cf117e7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"V0DjbtG/1Z/fpQJ6BgspW54a3PBM5nZ6aUbXwPFFias="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9653aeee-65c9-4d69-aade-66ae5c7fc043","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"IvVyeDOIO+waCDA+SztEuHF2D6M1C+5Rm31NE6QrbIs="}},"text":"This attempts \r\nto explain how learning can happen within an organisational con- \r\ntext.

The models of double-loop learning have been rec- \r\nommended by cyber security researchers ( Shedden et al., 2010 ; \r\nShedden et al., 2011 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2020 ), \r\nyet the models themselves give little guidance to practitioners \r\nin how to move an organisation towards this type of learning.

REWI categorised the attributes needed for resiliency against inci- \r\ndents as risk awareness, response capacity and support (technical, \r\nhuman and organisational).

(2014b) conducted two studies with students, the first \r\ntraining them in GSN techniques and asking them to evaluate it. The second asked students to map the causes of a simplified inci- \r\ndent using the GSN template to build a safety case. GSN was then \r\ntrialled at a Chinese healthcare provider ( He et al., 2014a ; He and \r\nJohnson, 2017 ). Feedback was mixed; while they found it could be \r\na valuable template for some groups such as those within the in- \r\ncident response team, it had some limitations for use with a wider \r\naudience.

Others have borrowed the Agile approach from software engi- \r\nneering ( Grispos et al., 2014 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ; He et al., 2022 ). The Manifesto for Agile Software Development has gained popu- \r\nlarity in the development of software products ( Beck et al., 2001 ). Grispos et al.

(2017) applied four needs assess- \r\nment categories: Organisation, Team, Individual and Instruments, \r\nas a tool to understand the skills CSIRTs needed. They found \r\norganisational learning from incidents needed to be improved \r\nand recommended improving performance by implementing a \r\nlessons learnt procedure. Tatu et al.

The lack of consensus on a framework for researching learning \r\npractices results in inconsistent approaches to describing the learn- \r\ning expected or found by researchers, as can be seen in Table 6 . 3.4.

Ahmad et al. (2015) emphasised the chance to learn about \r\ncritical assets, technology risks and the causal structures of se- \r\ncurity incidents from a wider selection of incidents. These ma- \r\njor incident reviews were also restricted to those directly involved \r\nwith the specific incident ( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2015 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ). For example, Ahmad et al. ( Ahmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2015 ) found only the technical \r\nteams were involved in the post-incident learning, which may re- \r\nstrict the identification of underlying causes to those of a technical \r\nnature. Grispos et al. ( Grispos et al., 2017 ) recognised the limita- \r\ntion of the incident response team not developing actions on the \r\nlessons learnt for areas outside their responsibility. Bartnes et al. ( Bartnes et al., 2016 ) suggested that organisations should consider \r\nthe use of trained facilitators to help the effectiveness of looking \r\nback to identify lessons from an incident although how this may \r\nhelp has yet to be studied. Furthermore, the researchers found that the identified lessons \r\nwere not shared beyond incident teams ( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; \r\nAhmad et al., 2012 ; Ahmad et al., 2015 ; Grispos et al., 2017 ). Line et al. (2006) emphasises the importance that lessons from \r\nincidents are shared with all parts of the organisation includ- \r\ning management, suppliers and employees. There were some ex- \r\nceptions where the lessons were shared. He and Johnson (2017) \r\nfound the healthcare provider they studied held informal meet- \r\nings to share the lessons learned with different stakeholders.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UGq40VjWMsDrdT9VT2nJHGXWZnW0ma+m/Pay0WgAfnU="},"0ca7f749-aa1f-4e5a-9c77-91352b29d3d5":{"id_":"0ca7f749-aa1f-4e5a-9c77-91352b29d3d5","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"uP5lNMDapoRaQw4lMo21wZi7FcomjnlTWWlVmillDR8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3ca850aa-6cee-4bde-8a22-78474659f068","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"UGq40VjWMsDrdT9VT2nJHGXWZnW0ma+m/Pay0WgAfnU="}},"text":"Baskerville et al.’s (2014) case study of three organisations (rail, \r\npostal, and military) found the postal organisation also began shar- \r\ning more incident data with its competitors following a serious in- \r\ncident.

Bartnes et al. (2016) highlighted minor incidents could be \r\na source of lessons for organisations and recommended they ex- \r\nplore double-loop learning when they do experience even minor \r\nincidents. The benefits of analysing minor incidents was not stud- \r\nied. In a study by Shedden et al. (2011) , informal learning within \r\nCSIRTs is explored through a focus group of five security profes- \r\nsionals. They saw an opportunity for organisations to embrace both \r\nformal and informal learning as these two learning approaches re- \r\ninforce each other. While it encourages organisations to leverage \r\ntheir informal learning capability, this paper does not provide spe- \r\ncific details on how to enable it. 3.5. Causal analysis \r\nThis part of the learning process from incidents received the \r\nmost attention from researchers. In several studies, respondents \r\nsupported the need for learning, but researchers found little ev- \r\nidence of thorough investigations to find the underlying causes \r\n( Jaatun et al., 2009 ; Ahmad et al., 2012 ). Grispos et al. (2015) found \r\nseven out of ten respondents said root cause analysis was per- \r\nformed post-incident and all ten saw an opportunity to improve \r\nsecurity measures using post-incident analysis. Shedden et al. (2010) found most research on incident response \r\nhad been technically focused and there was an opportunity to ap- \r\nply double-loop learning principles to identify underlying causes \r\nwhich could be addressed to strengthen incident response and the \r\nsecurity of organisations. Baskerville et al. (2014) found that in one \r\nof the three companies studied, double-loop learning was applied \r\nafter serious incidents, although there are few details on this in \r\nthe article. In a more recent study, Ahmad et al.

Learning practices \r\nWhilst it is generally agreed that organisations would bene- \r\nfit from improving how they learn from incidents, there is less \r\nconsensus on how best to achieve this or what is good practice. There is a lack of consensus on a consistent model and a com- \r\nmon nomenclature to describe learning, which slows the sharing \r\nof ideas and the propagation of good practice. This is not unusual \r\nfor a relatively new field of research such as cyber security and \r\neven in established fields such as management science, the use of \r\nmodels evolves over time ( Piazza and Abrahamson, 2020 ). How- \r\never, without any coalescing around a shared view of how to assess \r\nlearning from incidents, the progress of both academic research \r\nand the adoption by practitioners will be slower. There are opportunities to expand the research on learning \r\npractices to more industries and countries. In particular, research \r\nin less regulated and process-orientated organisations is needed, \r\nas the current literature has predominantly focused on the en- \r\nergy, finance and healthcare sectors. For instance, the public sec- \r\ntor, technology and critical national infrastructure, where the im- \r\npact of incidents could be significant, are important to study. Tøndel et al. (2014) also recommended collecting data from more \r\norganisations and studying them over a longer time frame. Future research questions: \r\n•What learning from incident practices are the most commonly used? •How do organisations in the public sector / technology sector / critical\r\n national infrastructure sector learn from incidents? 4.2. Evaluating the learning capability \r\nThere has been little attention to-date on how organisations \r\nexamine how effective they are at learning.

However, we are not aware of any studies yet to assess if these \r\napproaches would also apply to how cyber security teams can im- \r\nprove their learning from cyber security incidents. To fully under- \r\nstand this, future research needs to assess whether the measures \r\nimplemented due to lessons from incidents actually reduce the \r\nprevalence of future incidents. In the selected studies, none reported an attempt to measure \r\nhow learning from incidents improved security or reported the or- \r\nganisations studied evaluated their own ability to learn. Granted \r\nas already mentioned, it is difficult to robustly measure incidents, \r\nbut much of the research conducted is based on an implicit as- \r\nsumption that learning from incidents is positive without seeking \r\nexplicit evidence to confirm this view. Researchers found that post- \r\nincident reviews are typically only conducted on major incidents \r\nand not necessarily those with the greatest learning opportunities \r\nor time invested in learning from systemic causes ( Ahmad et al., \r\n2015 ; Bartnes et al., 2016 ). Few studies acknowledge the dilem- \r\nmas faced by organisations in taking the time and resources to \r\ninvest in learning. Ahmad et al. (2015) suggested that further re- \r\nsearch is needed on the competing priorities of security manage- \r\nment and incident response teams to understand how these can \r\nbe balanced to maximise the security of an organisation’s technol- \r\nogy. Whilst researchers have urged organisations to not only focus \r\non high impact incidents and have wider participation, more re- \r\nsearch is needed to understand the sweet-spot where investment \r\nin learning activities is outweighed by the benefits. This could be \r\nstudied by comparing organisations or divisions within organisa- \r\ntions which have invested different amount of time in learning ac- \r\ntivities and assessing the impact on the prevalence of incidents. However, the ability to make comparisons would need each organ- \r\nisation to be facing a similar volume of incidents as a baseline. However, using data to measure the efficacy of learning in re- \r\nducing the number of future incidents is extremely difficult due \r\nto the lack of independent or reliable sources of incident data \r\nreadily available to academic researchers ( Salane and Jay, 2011 ).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Fzm/78hksChcXL6qi2Il9TLexCfrQHV5WdyDUUj0gXI="},"35c4e2ab-bf8e-47e4-88ad-2762ab7abc3d":{"id_":"35c4e2ab-bf8e-47e4-88ad-2762ab7abc3d","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"8DgbeP8bZ5oi2PH+Wsyx6eKTZzwmyovKQKL68ydSTvE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a14f304a-479e-4931-93b9-4a6b08cdbd47","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"Fzm/78hksChcXL6qi2Il9TLexCfrQHV5WdyDUUj0gXI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4cdcf21c-27c3-40e0-b7f8-db926a826e89","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"uPV5wxFN00eyg+AAwI0A3yIXsa4Y9iQSJoMg97atu08="}},"text":"As Ryan and Jefferson (2003) concluded “In the information se- \r\ncurity arena, there is no reliable data upon which to base deci- \r\nsions.

Measuring the impact is \r\na challenge, but perhaps future studies could explore whether the \r\ninvestment in learning led to fewer significant incidents within an \r\norganisation based on their own incident metrics on frequency and \r\nimpact, as well as other performance indicators such as time to re- \r\nstore. Another option would be an exploration of repeat incidents \r\nor recurrent types of causes which could indicate improvements \r\nwere needed to the learning process (for example, several inci- \r\ndents attributed to vulnerabilities being introduced through inse- \r\ncure coding practices). Furthermore, research could be expanded \r\nto study the perspective of other stakeholders in the organisation, \r\nsuch as audit and risk committees, business leaders, boards, and \r\nregulators. Organisations need to balance the effort between learning \r\nfrom incidents with responding to them.

Unlike safety’s review of High Reliability Organisations \r\n(HRO), to understand how some high risk organisations manage to \r\nmaintain a low level of safety incidents ( la Porte, 1996 ), remarkably \r\nthere appears to be scant research into organisations which learn \r\nfrom cyber incidents and adapt well. Ahmad et al., (2020) sug- \r\ngested the use of their conceptual framework to study cyber se- \r\ncurity in HROs. Future research questions: \r\n•What are the optimal governance structures to enable decision- making\r\n and accountability for implementing lessons learned? •How does culture impact the ability of an organisation to learn from\r\n incidents? •What are the barriers that prevent organisations learning from incidents\r\n and how might these be overcome? •When compared, what enables some organisations / some in- dustries\r\n to be more effective at learning from incidents than others? 4.6. Practical implications \r\nResearchers have found little evidence of organisational learn- \r\ning beyond the incident management team improving their pro- \r\ncesses. The incident management industry standards intentionally \r\nallow organisations the flexibility to determine how to implement \r\nthem and they are centred on incident management rather than \r\nhow lessons could improve the overall security posture of an or- \r\nganisation. However, if incident management teams do not take \r\naccountability for learning from incidents they can find themselves \r\noverwhelmed with an increasing number of incidents with ris- \r\ning severity, as the underlying causes are not being addressed \r\n( Gonzalez, 2005 ). In contrast to safety science, how organisations \r\nlearn to learn from cyber security incidents or the barriers to such \r\nlearning has not been explicitly studied. It is evident more research \r\nin this area would be valuable. Most of the publications analysed have advocated for a more \r\nthorough causal analysis to identify the underlying causes. This is \r\neven more important in today’s complex and entwined IT systems \r\nwithin the context of an organisation and their IT providers.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"poytnEUhahMaxC5GZbJHo+6ihKYDyz0LlT1t0Tkdxd4="},"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53":{"id_":"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OB1lvMj77c0asdqY1GEiALkXk19315bsG9nadHaEIuw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ee39b0db-5377-4b6e-9b53-7f200c03f05f","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"poytnEUhahMaxC5GZbJHo+6ihKYDyz0LlT1t0Tkdxd4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"EHV0DElqcqHodR8yAiFlxvIKhsqpH9Jt/XB0OZF1cFE="}},"text":"Or- \r\nganisations need to consider the social aspects of incident inves- \r\ntigations and how to facilitate the most beneficial causal analysis \r\n( Tavris and Aronson, 2020 ; Edmondson, 2018 ). There is a risk or- \r\nganisations assemble a team of people involved in a specific inci- \r\ndent and unintentional hindsight bias leads them to miss critical \r\ncontributory factors ( Cook, 1998 ). Security practitioners can start \r\nby evaluating how well their organisation has been learning from \r\nincidents using the process outlined in Fig. 1 . This will enable them \r\nto consider; if the right people are involved (as this impacts the \r\npotential lessons learned), how well systematic causes are iden- \r\ntified and addressed, and then assess if this helps to reduce the \r\nprevalence of incidents. 4.7. Limitations \r\nThis study focused on learning from cyber security incidents. It is possible research in other fields of technology, safety, natu- \r\nral disasters and other types of incidents could offer additional in- \r\nsights. Whilst steps were taken to ensure all relevant papers within \r\nthe cyber security domain were identified, there remains a pos- \r\nsibility some were missed due to the reliance on search strings, \r\nthe indexing, categorisation, and search capabilities of the online \r\ndatabases. We only included articles written in English for which \r\nthe full text was accessible, which resulted in 11 papers being ex- \r\ncluded. Therefore, there is a risk some conclusions about the re- \r\nsearch in this area were missed. However, considering the number \r\nof studies reviewed and the similarity of findings, it is assumed \r\nthis had a minimal impact on our assertions. 5. Conclusion \r\nSecurity incidents pose a huge threat to society. There is more \r\ndata than ever before, and the complex web of systems and suppli- \r\ners means we are more vulnerable to incidents. The standards used \r\nby practitioners recommend learning from incidents, but these \r\ndocuments do not provide much guidance on how to do this well. Yet there has been relatively few studies on this topic in cyber se- \r\ncurity. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and research agenda \r\nhave structured the existing research into how organisations learn \r\nfrom cyber security incidents and suggested where future research \r\nis needed to propel the field forward.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jkqgP8bH6iBWv2RCAX9Ejzry1TJU2s141YKQh110EaA="},"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d":{"id_":"01074a5a-7ea5-49ee-bb30-9b16298e020d","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"OB1lvMj77c0asdqY1GEiALkXk19315bsG9nadHaEIuw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"72105511-15af-4e1e-be62-5fd0614f9f53","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"jkqgP8bH6iBWv2RCAX9Ejzry1TJU2s141YKQh110EaA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"55b98141-9543-4d56-8822-6ea917d46c9e","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf","file_name":"Learning from cyber security incidents - A systematic review and future research agenda.pdf"},"hash":"rgZKL9W7JuUV2JFf7FBQ//ovG6R0OQsoXjX9vH4DFT8="}},"text":"By providing an overview \r\nof the topic, we hope the analysis of the literature will serve as a \r\nvaluable resource for those researchers interested in exploring the \r\nfuture research opportunities highlighted. The literature has more emphasis on acquiring knowledge \r\nthrough post-incident investigations with less attention on the \r\nimplementation of the lessons. There has been no consistent \r\nmodel applied to assess how organisations learn from incidents. Those studies which have been conducted, recommend organisa- \r\ntions should improve learning from incidents with wider partici- \r\npation and sharing of post-incident reports, often suggesting us- \r\ning double-loop learning in the investigations to address systemic \r\ncauses. The research has shown organisations are not yet benefit- \r\nting as much as possible from learning from incidents and are not \r\nevaluating if their learning is effective. The analysis of the literature highlighted unanswered questions \r\nwhich were organised into a future research agenda. Fourteen re- \r\nsearch questions have been suggested and how these could be \r\nstudied discussed. Further studies are recommended to explore \r\nwhat prevents organisations from understanding the underlying \r\ncauses to identify the improvements needed and to implement \r\nthem to reduce the risk of incidents in the future. In addition, ap- \r\nproaching it from the opposite side and researching High Reliabil- \r\nity Organisations (HRO) that learn well would be beneficial. Identifying the valuable lessons within an organisation’s social \r\nand political environment requires effort. Ensuring the lessons lead \r\nto useful changes that prevent further incidents requires organisa- \r\ntions to evaluate how well they are learning. Further research is \r\nneeded to identify how organisations can invest in learning to see \r\nthe greatest benefits. By improving how organisations learn from \r\nincidents it is hoped they can reduce the likelihood and impact of \r\ncyber security incidents happening in the future. This will help to \r\nreduce the risks society faces from its dependence on IT.

INTRODUCTION \r\nProductivity  in  incident  management  worldwide  in  companies  is  scalable  and  optimizable. This \r\nproductivity according to [1], is a very important indicator that defines the quantification of the products or \r\nservices produced based on the resources used. In turn, the difference in productivity between companies is \r\nrelated to three common situations such as: i) experience and knowledge of the partners, ii) use of technologies, \r\nand iii) organizational structure. The primary goal for a business is to increase productivity and positively affect \r\nit to generate value for the product or service that is provided to the end user. Therefore, in [2], [3] the authors \r\nstate  that  automation  in  the information  technology environment  is  considered  a  foundation  for  increasing \r\nproductivity  and  quality  of  services. The  use  of technology,  is  important  to  take  advantage  of  its  rapid \r\ndevelopment by integrating the tools it provides, resulting in great benefits [4]. In the same way, by investing \r\nin and implementing ICT, companies can increase  their productivity and staff performance, while reducing \r\ncosts [5], since, is proven to provide automated student queries with an accuracy that is above 75%. On the \r\nother  hand,  in  the  technological  area,  there  are  many  relevant  advances,  for  example,  Eliza,  a  bot-based \r\nprogram  developed  in  the  late  1970s  by  MIT  professor  Joseph  Weizenbaum, [6] is  said  to  be  the  first \r\nconversational bot that can answer questions and engage in conversation depending on the words or phrases it \r\nreceives.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wDjBz6nNUwv9hMrM/g9UJzihdfLXxoksMflCdvLcMyI="},"c8698651-22cb-4630-8411-55a12e59ecdb":{"id_":"c8698651-22cb-4630-8411-55a12e59ecdb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"AB/VXWnviEm9ZjwO6wxS+u7M6JtCA8nB1nN5wnipvR8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"26cffc3b-f152-4d20-bf35-daebca677980","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"wDjBz6nNUwv9hMrM/g9UJzihdfLXxoksMflCdvLcMyI="}},"text":"This was the beginning of advances in the research and improvement of artificial intelligence (AI) \r\nthat   could   later   perform   jobs   effectively.

The authors, in [9] mention that, for customer management and satisfaction, \r\nthe company's activities must be addressed by a quality management system. From the point of view of information technology (IT), an incident is considered as the interruption \r\nof the services offered by a company, which can be reported by users or, on the contrary, it can be generated \r\nby  applications  in  an  automated  way [10],  In [11] it  is  stated  that  an  incident  management  system  has  the \r\npurpose  of  providing  resolutive  attention  to  the  users  within  the  shortest  possible  time  and  acts  as  an \r\ninformation center in charge of managing the monitoring, registration, and follow-up of the incidents; likewise, \r\nin [11] it  is  mentioned  that  the  purpose  of  the  implementation  of  ITIL-based  models  to  manage  incidents \r\nincreases the quality of the service, and according to [12], The status of incidents can vary between assigned \r\n(which  does  not  allow  adding  violations),  closed  (which  does  not  allow  modification)  and  open  (default or \r\ninitial status of the incident). Incidents can be related to customer service, and request processes, among others. In IT, incident management with conversational bots is of great support, since it allows streamlining processes \r\nto  meet  the  needs  of  customers  according  to  their  needs [13]. Similarly,  the  steps  involved  in  incident \r\nmanagement are  incident entry, registration, classification, diagnosis, resolution, control, and closure of the \r\nincident. Good incident management will allow companies to have better interaction with both their internal \r\nand external customers [14].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aTsZPshIcz0pXVtcyuS1JSKd2+IsbRftp/ee4PB0oj8="},"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8":{"id_":"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"d4ISLt9r/o9vi2tnywwmj4EXWH5voAVI5kmJPE7EZz8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f85c726b-8e31-4aa8-8db5-dd317bcf1012","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"aTsZPshIcz0pXVtcyuS1JSKd2+IsbRftp/ee4PB0oj8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"8IqcVF2V8bwcuMCwPaQFCgwL+8CuMNyB1XGEqYp1EfQ="}},"text":"The use of chatbots allows to solve the problems that the user might currently have, besides being a \r\nbeneficial tool in customer service, it can reduce up to 30% of care costs [15], however, it is normal to find that \r\nit most important use is in entertainment and as a complementary messaging software; it is also frequently used \r\nas  a  virtual  assistant  on  websites,  highlighting  that  this  can  be  the  subject  of  research  for  larger  purposes.

REVIEW OF RELATED WORK \r\n2.1. Bots in software engineering \r\nIn [16], the authors relate chatbots in software engineering. The scope of bots in software engineering \r\nand their application is broad, as it is considered that bots should be analyzed to provide a general picture of \r\nwhy  and  how  they  should  be  applied  in  software  engineering. Also,  they  mention  that  bots  are  more  than \r\nautomated  scripts,  but  that  they  can  become  systems  that  make  decisions;  as  in [17] where  an  artificial \r\nintelligence machine LAMBDA, tries to convince its creators that it thinks and feels after several conversations, \r\nis exposed. 2.2. Bots in the health sector \r\nIn the health sector, in [18], [19] the authors indicate that conversational interfaces (CI) have been \r\nimplemented  in  different  forms  applied  for  health  and  behavioral  intervention  purposes,  patient  self-\r\nmanagement, and clinical decision support, based on information extracted from a review of 42 funded projects, \r\n428  research  publications,  and  162  patents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+gZBx+z5OwHvAefndShXXCj9uR9ACmW+MOFirPZKfuQ="},"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913":{"id_":"6f14ef8e-da79-4492-9e81-e45e314b9913","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"d4ISLt9r/o9vi2tnywwmj4EXWH5voAVI5kmJPE7EZz8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"97dc84c5-0976-4cdf-bb81-205590bb87c8","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"+gZBx+z5OwHvAefndShXXCj9uR9ACmW+MOFirPZKfuQ="}},"text":"Similarly,  according  to [19] the  increase  in  demand  for  mental \r\nhealth care has been driving. Also, the development of digital mental health interventions (DMHI), generated \r\nthat conversational bots are integrated into DMHI as support in diagnosis, detection, symptom management, \r\nbehavior change, and content delivery; however, only 24% of DMHI entities consider a chatbot and a small \r\nnumber of professionals have had interaction with them on this topic. In terms of solution evaluation, the authors state that the means to verify user satisfaction through the \r\nuse of conversational bots are not currently standardized. In [20] the authors describe four studies, where the \r\noverall  sample  of  141  survey  participants  (experts  and  novices)  to  define  attributes  for  interaction  quality \r\ntesting,  designed  and  piloted  a  new  scale  to  measure  satisfaction  after  an  experience  with  conversational \r\nchatbots. This arises for the diagnosis of a checklist (BOT-Check), a 15-item questionnaire (BOT Usability \r\nScale, BUS-15) with estimated reliability between 0.76 and 0.87 distributed over five factors; however, the \r\nlatter requires further validation testing. Likewise, in the AI categories, in [21] reference is made to interactive \r\nAI, which enables efficient and interactive communication automation, which is oriented to the commercial \r\nsphere.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \r\nThis section presents the bibliometric analysis and detailed analysis of previous work. The first part \r\nshows the relationships between the common terms concerning incident management with conversational bots \r\nand density visualization. The second part seeks to find the scientific gap between the manuscripts proposed in \r\nthis study to develop an architectural model that allows the implementation of a conversational bot for incident \r\nmanagement. 4.1. Bibliometric analysis \r\nVOSviewer  has  been  used,  which,  according  to [72],  is  a  research  tool  for  creating  bibliometric \r\nnetworks based on manuscripts and journals, also, it applies text mining in the creation and visualization of co-\r\noccurrence  networks  on  relevant  words. This  tool  helped  the  study  with  visual  information,  allowing  us  to \r\nvisualize the keywords associated with incident management with conversational bots. It also helped to identify \r\nthe benefits, types, and processes that optimize conversational chatbots in clusters. The VOSviewer divides the \r\nterminology into clusters according to their relevance to one another. Figure 3 represents the visualization of \r\nthe bibliometric map showing the relationships between the most used terminology and how it is linked. The \r\nlargest node represents the most used terminology in the manuscripts, and its size represents the number of \r\ntimes these words appear in the manuscripts. The analysis was performed on the title and abstract using a binary counting method of 108 keywords \r\nexamined with a minimum threshold of 2 occurrences, resulting in 28 terminologies, as shown in Figure 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4w6Rc3aA4Yz/F0Wplf1nDQZR0yftmmJ9P8LPit2LKzY="},"de946c02-0fa1-4736-b719-03c8711f53d6":{"id_":"de946c02-0fa1-4736-b719-03c8711f53d6","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"5ku7EiWrLP8yhKYzXoMeTghZzhYB5k0geKWkV3qdK24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b8b61da-ad94-46ff-acea-673a73533ad1","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"4w6Rc3aA4Yz/F0Wplf1nDQZR0yftmmJ9P8LPit2LKzY="}},"text":"The \r\nlargest nodes representing each cluster in the network map are determined as a cluster of “artificial intelligence” \r\n(red), a cluster of “conversational agent” (green), a cluster of “natural language processing” (violet) cluster of \r\n“ai” (blue), and, finally, cluster de “chatbot” (sky blue).

Whereas, the author [52] presented a chatbot that communicates with the \r\ncustomer in a variety of interaction styles that allows pleasant online ordering. These chatbots serve as guides \r\nin information systems, [63] features a chatbot that guides the user to perform banking transactions, while [27] \r\nhas created a chatbot that serves as a guide for visually impaired customers. It is noted that 2 authors describe \r\nconversational chatbots that are social, while 2 others present those that serve as guides. In [24] introduced  two  agents  with  a  wealth  of  voice- and  text-based  diabetes  information,  AIDA \r\nChatbot,  and  AIDA  Cookbot,  to  support  diabetes  patients,  physicians,  and  caregivers  in  text-based  dietary \r\nrecommendations  for  diabetic  patients. Similarly, [67] presented conversational  agents  using  mHealth \r\ninterventions,  to  generate  healthy  lifestyle  changes  for  audiences  with  diabetes  disease. While [39],  [47] \r\npresented  a  conversational  system  that  interacts  with  the  user  so  that  it  can  provide  more  precise \r\nrecommendations according to the user's context. In education [54] bots can be used in educational or general presentations to enhance interaction; they \r\nare  also conversation-based learning support frameworks. Whereas, [57] mentions that these conversational \r\nbots  adopt  relevant  educational  approaches  and  technology-enhanced  learning. Given such  research,  it  is \r\nreaffirmed that the application of chatbot technology is fully favorable in the educational sector.

Manuscript analysis \r\nSeven databases of manuscript results were used for the search, the number of manuscripts retrieved \r\nwas a total of six hundred and fifty-seven (657) in the initial search, and the final results with a total of forty-\r\nseven (47) manuscripts. As presented in Table 5. The initial search of manuscripts has gone through a cleaning \r\nprocess using the PRISMA methodology, where phase 1 shows the initial search, phase 2 after eliminating the \r\n15 duplicates and those that are not related to the research topic, phase 3 has 47 manuscripts that are related to \r\nthe research topic. For more detail, Figure 5 shows the number of manuscripts by databases, with Scopus with \r\n21, the source that maintained the highest number of manuscripts after the filters. Also shown is the number of \r\nmanuscripts  obtained  in  the  other  databases  such  as  Springer  5,  Willy  1,  Indices  10,  Taylor  &  Francis, \r\nEbscohost 5 and Pubmed with 3.

PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE \r\nAfter analyzing the manuscripts related to incident management with conversational bots, we have \r\nfound very customized architecture models that do not adapt to multiple realities; therefore, in this section, we \r\npropose an architecture model that adapts to different realities and contexts. The proposed architecture model \r\ncalled  (LUWI),  seeks  to  improve  incident  management  and  has  characteristics  such  as  interactivity,  semi-\r\nhuman  conversation,  informative  assistance, and novelty. This  model  has  3  modules  which  are:  Users, \r\nInteraction channels,  and  Conversational  Chatbot. These  modules  are  mutually  related  for  their  optimal \r\nfunctioning. As shown in Figure 7. In modules 1 and 2, the user communicates with the chatbot via SMS, Web Page, or E-mail. The user \r\ncan ask the conversational chatbot (CC) what he/she needs. The CC has a data input and an information output. In module 3, in the input, the CC receives data from the user, in turn, this data goes through 3 stages to give a \r\nresponse to the user. In stage 1, there is the information extraction module which contains 6 components, dialog \r\nstate tracker (DST), neural intent encoding (NIE), NLC, NLP, and neural recommender system (NRS). Where \r\nDST, NIE, NLC, and NLP are responsible for understanding what the user wants by analyzing the context of \r\nthe dialog. Then, the data is studied by the NRS which generates a recommendation that will be sent and stored \r\nin the knowledge base (KD). In stage 2, the KD of the conversational chat CC interacts with 2 components: \r\nmachine  learning (ML) and business logic (BL). The  CC evaluates the  initial extraction data  by interacting \r\nwith the ML model where the results are stored in the KD in question and answer format.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UGRCQJrJ5x/tS4RXgNnj6Pc4FZFX+pG33Z2M/59MoI8="},"727b4821-882a-4b31-8569-c059eb53ad3b":{"id_":"727b4821-882a-4b31-8569-c059eb53ad3b","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"BkorvKV8bKEfBdrZY31Zevaa9dYtw/cIwxTd+UK36sA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d4acce63-4adf-4fa6-b782-8e3116c8e149","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"UGRCQJrJ5x/tS4RXgNnj6Pc4FZFX+pG33Z2M/59MoI8="}},"text":"In turn, the model is \r\ntrained  to  assert  its  learning  with  the  interaction  of  many  data. Then,  the  KD  interacts  with  the  BL, i.e. it \r\nmanages the incidents through the system connected to a database focused on the first 4/8 ITIL processes which \r\nare: \r\n1. Incident registration. 2. Incident categorization. 3. Incident prioritization. 4. Incident assignment. 5. Task creation and management. 6. SLA management and escalation. 7. Incident resolution. 8. Incident closure. In stage 3, we have module 3, CRG response generator, this module has 3 components: neural policy \r\nagent  (NPA),  natural  language  generator  (NLG),  and  neural  variation  interface  network  (NVI). These \r\ncomponents  are  in  charge  of  processing  the  information  contained  in  the  knowledge  base,  where  the  NPA \r\ndetermines the type of decisión-related to the current dialogue, NLG helps to create conversational responses \r\nin the context identified in stage 1.

(Luz Obregon-Palomino) \r\n1553 \r\n6. CONCLUSION \r\nIn  this  SLR  where  research  papers  from  2019  to  2022  have  been  analyzed,  an  initial  set  of  657 \r\nmanuscripts were found, and 47 manuscripts were carefully selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria using \r\nPRISMA methodology. This review provides the reader with insights into the benefits, types of conversational \r\nbots, and processes that improve after the use of these bots. The research questions focus on 3 main points. Firstly, we identified the benefits of conversational bots where 2/19 very important benefits were obtained such \r\nas: \"helping to obtain information\" and \"Facilitating customer service\" with a total of 6 manuscripts referring \r\nto it. Secondly, in the  types of conversational bots, a  total of 9 types of conversational bots were found, of \r\nwhich  2  are  the  most  used:  \"Conversational  agents\"  and  \"Chatbots  with  AI\". Thirdly,  3/5  processes  that \r\noptimize  conversational  bots were  found,  where  the  most prominent  ones  are:  \"Teaching  process\",  \"Health \r\nprocesses\" and \"Customer service processes\". Conversational bots can be applied in any sector, both in public \r\nentities  and  private  companies,  to  improve  their  productivity  by  streamlining  customer  service  processes, \r\npersonalized recommendations, and teaching, among others, through communicative interaction. Finally, the \r\nresults of this study will help future researchers to take as a basis the knowledge of conversational automated \r\nsystems and be able to develop them in companies to efficiently manage the incidents that may arise.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OLgdpe81qcTd6SZcADs+1Zurq2OmtZTFFzTaLcYXJSo="},"49f79edc-6cf6-46e8-a92a-a8f10068505c":{"id_":"49f79edc-6cf6-46e8-a92a-a8f10068505c","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"1lduv7rGX7YPqrxKZiFRcv61RsbbYzGMUhF+vd51QFI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a0023a3a-59db-4aa7-8b96-74b41c089230","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"OLgdpe81qcTd6SZcADs+1Zurq2OmtZTFFzTaLcYXJSo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b57d123c-6374-4832-85c0-aef814e2eec1","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf","file_name":"Productivity of incident management with conversational bots-a review.pdf"},"hash":"GXBtPRcLMZLiMy1ZQthXqUO6dCXp9LPv2+4ntneeEw0="}},"text":"In this \r\nway,  this  study  proposes  an  architecture  model  (LUWI)  that  allows  the  conversational  chatbot  to  adapt  to \r\ndifferent process environments where interactivity and communication are very relevant features accompanied \r\nby  the  personalization  of  learning  and  understanding  of  natural  language  through  ML,  focused  on  the \r\nframework of ITIL best practices to manage incidents.

Considering\r\nthe  available  information,  a  brief  description  of  the  security  threat,  ransom  amount,  and  impact  on  the\r\norganization are discussed for each incident. This review reports an increased frequency of cybersecurity threats\r\nto  the  FA  sector. To  minimize  these  cyber  risks,  popular  cybersecurity  frameworks  and  recent  agriculture-\r\nspecific  cybersecurity  solutions  are  also  discussed. Further,  the  need  for  AI  assurance  in  the  FA  sector  is\r\nexplained, and the Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) framework is proposed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NzVfakFMdx2DA+xh7jSFQB7bgRXPkd5moZt7fwv+YZw="},"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755":{"id_":"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mAFNQhpSafNpKHErTkjO4G/3sb9L72rCPhKTPR4Lq24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7479f149-31e7-414b-930f-ab206ab74fb9","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"NzVfakFMdx2DA+xh7jSFQB7bgRXPkd5moZt7fwv+YZw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"laKE+f7CNxYhzsyJNppSRrA3geekj8XqtRzP4ySPS8Q="}},"text":"The main aim of the FCAI framework\r\nis  to  support  farmers  in  decision-making  for  agricultural  production,  by  incorporating  AI  assurance. Lastly,\r\nthe effects of the reported cyber incidents on other critical infrastructures, food security, and the economy are\r\nnoted, along with specifying the open issues for future development. 1    Introduction\r\nCritical infrastructures are “the assets, systems, networks, facilities, and other elements that society relies upon\r\nto  maintain  national  security,  economic  vitality,  and  public  health,  and  safety”   [1]. The  U.S. Department\r\nof  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  categorized  the  16  critical  infrastructure  sectors  as  follows:   1)  Chemical,  2)\r\nCommercial Facilities, 3) Communications, 4) Critical Manufacturing, 5) Dams, 6) Defense Industrial Base, 7)\r\nEmergency Services, 8) Energy, 9) Financial Services, 10) Food and Agriculture, 11) Government Facilities, 12)\r\nHealthcare and Public Health, 13) Information Technology, 14) Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, 15)\r\nTransportation Systems, and 16) Water and Wastewater Systems [1]. The elements of these 16 infrastructure\r\nsectors  have  connections  and  interdependencies  [2],  and  losing  one  or  more  lifeline  functions  immediately\r\nimpacts the others. For this survey study, the focus is on the Food and Agriculture (FA) sector. In 2021, the\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)[3] reported that agriculture and related industries have a 5.4% share\r\n($1.264  trillion)  of  the  U.S. Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP),  and  farms  contribute  about  0.7%  ($164.7)  of\r\nthe U.S. GDP. Additionally, the FA sector provided 10.5% (21.1 million) of the U.S. employment in 2021, and\r\nan average American household spends 12% of their household’s budget on food [3].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8/uAmFOsYUp9uDcaeyYyzrOxw4hUDum0BxDSAPur08I="},"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438":{"id_":"208ebdba-36cc-42db-bcf8-5eb027ad7438","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mAFNQhpSafNpKHErTkjO4G/3sb9L72rCPhKTPR4Lq24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"db5939d7-0b09-4191-b478-4fea9b2ee755","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"8/uAmFOsYUp9uDcaeyYyzrOxw4hUDum0BxDSAPur08I="}},"text":"Based on the Food and\r\nAgriculture  Organization  (FAO)  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  the  global  demand  for  food  will  grow  to  70%\r\nto meet the population by 2050 [4].

It is deemed\r\npossible to increase the quantity and quality of agriculture and food products using these emerging technologies\r\nin  the  farm  management  cycle    [6]. This  new  age  of  agriculture  is  refered  to  as  Agriculture  4.0  [7]. A\r\nsmart farm is a cyber-physical system whose operations can be monitored and controlled by a computer and\r\ncommunication  system  using  a  set  of  networked  agents  [8,  9]. These  network  agents  can  be  sensors,  linear\r\nactuators,  control  processing  units,  and  communication  devices  [10]. As  noted  by  Zanella  et  al. [11],  smart\r\nfarming  utilizes  emerging  technologies,  and  due  to  their  complexity,  it  incorporates  all  the  security  problems\r\npresent in these technologies into smart farms, making them vulnerable to security threats.

For instance, DoS/DDoS attacks can halt the data transfer between a\r\nfarm and a food producer, affecting the farmer’s decision-making. Similarly, ransomware attacks can interrupt\r\ndaily agricultural operations such as mixing fertilizers and logistical operations,  or halting operations in food\r\nprocessing plants. Thus, a review of the actual cybersecurity incidents can assist in making better cyber policies,\r\nstrategies, and defense solutions across the board. Recently, Hassanzadeh et al. [31] have documented fifteen\r\nactual  cybersecurity  incidents  in  the  Water  and  Wastewater  sector.

The  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)\r\nand the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published ISO/IEC 27000 security standards, which\r\nare  also  commonly  used  in  different  organizations  [101]. Recently,  the  U.S. Cybersecurity  and  Infrastructure\r\nSecurity Agency (CISA) [102] recommended using the MITRE’s Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, & Common\r\nKnowledge (ATT&CK) CSF to develop adversary profiles, conduct activity trend analysis, and augment reports\r\nfor detection, response, and mitigation purposes. ATT&CK has also been used by the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization (NATO) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and modeling threats [103, 104]. Considering these\r\nreasons, NIST, CIS, ISO 27000, and ATT&CK are reported in this sub-section.

It  describes  essential  cybersecurity  outcomes  that\r\ncan  be  used  to  understand,  assess,  prioritize,  and  communicate  cybersecurity  risks  in  organizations.

Based  on  the  official  resource  [108],  the  development  of  the  benchmarks\r\nis  a  seven-step  process:  engage  the  community,  define  scope,  create  a  draft,  consensus  begins,  discuss  and\r\nadjust, consensus met, and publish CIS Benchmark. This process involves subject matter experts, technology\r\nvendors, public, private and academic community members. Every recommendation in a benchmark provides\r\na  detailed  discussion  of  profile  applicability,  description  of  the  recommendation,  rationale,  impact,  audit  of\r\nthe  recommendation,  and  remediation. The  organizations  can  select  a  suitable  benchmark  based  on  their\r\ntechnology, and additional CIS Foundation Benchmarks can be found on their official website. 3.1.3    ISO/IEC 27000 series\r\nISO/IEC  27000  series  is  a  family  of  standards  for  Information  Security  Management  Systems  (ISMS)  using\r\nwhich  organizations  can  become  risk-aware  to  identify  and  address  weaknesses  [112].

Based on the design and philosophy of ATT&CK [110],  Tactics represent\r\nthe “why” that focuses on the adversary’s technical goals, the reason for an action, and what they are trying to\r\nachieve. The Techniques answer “how” an action achieves a tactical goal, while Sub-techniques give a granular\r\ndescription of techniques. Lastly, Procedure indicates “what” an adversary did and how they used a Technique\r\nor Sub-technique. Overall, the ATT&CK framework for enterprise includes 14 tactics, 193 techniques, and 401\r\nsub-techniques. Companies such as Cisco [114], Fortnite [115], Claroty [116], and AttackIQ [117] have signified\r\nthe  importance  of  using  ATT&CK  for  CTI.

[156] developed DoS/DDoS attack detection frameworks to secure Agricultural 4.0 infrastructure. They\r\nused Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), CNN, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) – three different DL techniques\r\n– and compared their performance. For experiments, the authors used two datasets - CIC-DDoS2019 [157] and\r\nTON-IoT datasets [142] – and the performance of the models was compared based on traditional evaluation\r\nmetrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC. The authors concluded that CNN provided an accuracy\r\nof 99.95% for binary network traffic attack detection and 99.2% for multiclass network traffic attack detection,\r\noutperforming  the  other  two  DL  models. Later  in  2023,  Kethineni  and  Pradeepini  [158]  developed  a  fused\r\nCNN  model  with  a  Bi-GRU  for  detecting  DoS/DDoS  attacks. The  data  preprocessing  -  label  encoding  and\r\ndata normalization - is performed in the input layer, which gives this preprocessed data to the Bi-GRU layer. The Bi-GRU layer consists of two GRUs and the attention layer. The attention layer is vital because it helps\r\nfind  the  essential  features  to  detect  DDoS  attacks. The  output  from  the  Bi-GRU  layer  is  then  given  to  the\r\nconvolution  layer  to  extract  deeper  features  from  the  data. Lastly,  the  output  layer,  which  consists  of  the\r\nSoftMax  function,  receives  these  features  that  classify  the  regular  and  DDoS  attack  instances. The  authors\r\ntested this framework on APA-DDoS-Attack [157] and TON-IoT datasets [142], which resulted in 99.35% and\r\n99.71% accuracy in attack detection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4opNJuaDcz1FyVHyL6bvroZJG0/79DifL/s6jebtaYc="},"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef":{"id_":"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bLOw+364nGncaYR0G2daCE/yfidUOsiUwnGqJkzOQbg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3e6c9417-0ad4-490e-963a-adf3c6faba93","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"4opNJuaDcz1FyVHyL6bvroZJG0/79DifL/s6jebtaYc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"vDBRY/e00lsE6bSKiWIieEYJAYJ83nUSKSielBtiqm8="}},"text":"In 2022, Privacy-encoding-based Federated Learning (PEFL) [159], and Federated Learning-based Intru-\r\nsion  Detection  System  (FELIDS)  [160]  frameworks  are  proposed  to  ensure  data  security  and  privacy  while\r\nperforming  network  attack  detection. The  PEFL  framework  has  two  levels  of  data  privacy  and  a  Federated\r\nLearning integrated GRU (FedGRU) for intrusion detection. The first privacy level is based on perturbation-\r\nbased  encoding,  responsible  for  feature  mapping  and  normalization. Next,  DL-based  LSTM  Autoencoder\r\n(LSTM-AE)  is  applied  for  data  transformation  in  the  second  privacy  level  of  the  PEFL  framework. Lastly,\r\nthis transformed data is then given to the FedGRU module, responsible for classifying normal and attack data\r\ninstances. The authors used the ToN-IoT dataset [142] for experimentation and compared performance using\r\ntraditional classification metrics with other existing Federated Learning (FL) based techniques. Based on the\r\nresults, the authors concluded that the PEFL framework improved the attack detection rate, precision, and F1\r\nscore  for  the  ToN-IoT  dataset  compared  to  the  non-FL  and  FL  techniques. For  the  FELIDS  framework,  the\r\nmotivation was to maintain data privacy via local learning, i.e., sharing the model updates with the aggregation\r\nserver without sharing the entire data. In this framework, the authors used and compared three DL classifiers\r\n-  DNN,  CNN,  and  RNN. For  experiments,  the  authors  [160]  used  three  datasets  -  CSE-CIC-IDS2018  [154],\r\nMQTTset  [161],  and  InSDN  [162]  –  and  evaluated  the  performance  using  traditional  classification  metrics. They compared the performance of FELIDS with centralized DL models and noted that FELIDS provided the\r\nhighest accuracy in detecting attacks.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cSS2rG/zsg3EHEYBlQoOdQyyok1mLgIMZsn4JVB1zhs="},"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e":{"id_":"a94606f2-6163-4a24-a808-dfe507c6c40e","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bLOw+364nGncaYR0G2daCE/yfidUOsiUwnGqJkzOQbg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4ba5d257-a8a3-4220-a825-9cdb523b27ef","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"cSS2rG/zsg3EHEYBlQoOdQyyok1mLgIMZsn4JVB1zhs="}},"text":"Table 6:Recent  agriculture-specific  cybersecurity  solutions  that  combine  different  DL,  ML,  blockchain,  and\r\nFederated Learning (FL) based techniques.

Agri-\r\nculture  is  a  labor  and  time-intensive  work  evolving  to  increase  efficiency  and  food  production  to  satisfy  the\r\ngrowing demand [163]. To achieve these objectives, many farms have adopted AI to perform agricultural au-\r\ntomation [164]. It has been noted that many farm machinery companies are using field equipment to capture\r\ndata from the farms and transfer it to the centralized database [165, 137, 136, 166, 167]. This data is then\r\nfurther  used  in  AI  models  to  assist  farmers  in  decision-making. There  are  many  agricultural  AI  applications\r\nsuch as production management, crop monitoring, crop disease detection, food quality assessment, intelligent\r\nspraying of pesticides, soil management, and harvesting [168, 164] where the collected has been used. Recently,\r\nCross et al. [169] developed an AI-based decision support tool that can detect changes in the feeding behavior\r\nof pigs and provide warnings of potential disease outbreaks. A decision-support tool like this can be used by\r\nfarmers to take preventive actions that could increase the productivity of the animals. The other recent signif-\r\nicant application of AI is irrigation management. King and Shellie [170] used ANN to predict the Crop Water\r\nStress Index (CWSI). The objective was to develop a decision-support tool for wine grape production to assist\r\nwith irrigation. The development of AI-driven decision-support tools has also been reported for crop nutrient\r\nmanagement,  especially  to  recommend  optimum  Nitrogen  (N)  fertilizer  levels  for  corn  [171,  172,  173,  174]. The  N  fertilizers  play  a  crucial  role  in  corn  production  as  the  amount  of  N  fertilizers  affect  the  corn  yield,\r\naffecting profit and may cause pollution [173].

For  example,  let  us  assume  that  a  farmer  uses  an  AI-driven  N  fertilizer  recom-\r\nmender tool. When the soil pH level – a soil characteristic parameter - is high, the tool recommends increasing\r\nthe N input. This increases risks, and due to a lack of transparency, it is impossible to understand how the AI\r\nmodel  is  making  those  recommendations. Suppose  an  attacker  performs  a  DoS/DDoS  attack  on  the  farm’s\r\nnetwork. In that case, the pH parameters can be compromised, causing data poisoning and affecting recom-\r\nmendations on the optimum amount of N fertilizer [156]. This may result in massive losses to the farmer, as\r\nwell  as  causing  environmental  pollution. Additionally,  several  AI  challenges,  such  as  model  bias,  adversarial\r\nattacks,  data,  and  model  security,  affect  process  automation,  resulting  in  reduced  performance  of  IDSs  for\r\nthreat detection [175]. This creates a need to validate and verify (i.e.,  assure) an AI tool that the users can\r\ntrust. Further,  agriculture  is  a  primary  pillar  of  the  global  bioeconomy  [176],  which  highlights  the  following:\r\n“AI  must  be  ethical  to  make  the  right  decisions,  safe  to  protect  users  it  potentially  impacts,  explainable  so\r\nhumans  can  understand  it,  fair  in  the  decisions  it  makes,  trustworthy  so  we  have  confidence  in  its  abilities\r\nand secure to prevent cyberattacks and threats” [177]. Thus, it is crucial to deploy AI assurance as farms are\r\ngetting more digitized to validate and verify the AI models used.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"m2ld+/2lBaFp/zDyiNCCdSQsbGq5X/WYBAZfZ6/DkFk="},"42c5bdb7-3e1f-4c85-b45f-ddd96d86680b":{"id_":"42c5bdb7-3e1f-4c85-b45f-ddd96d86680b","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mp9iky7QIqnuBeM7pHX5wjpaJh0O+N/KnBvmtFA12oA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7fa06829-6251-4f1e-a2c1-d1c16d989935","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"m2ld+/2lBaFp/zDyiNCCdSQsbGq5X/WYBAZfZ6/DkFk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"700fe7a1-d29c-4c5a-9c3a-a579c0b1bd8e","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="}},"text":"AI  assurance  can  be  defined  as  a  “process  that  is  applied  at  all  stages  of  the  AI  engineering  lifecycle\r\nensuring  that  any  intelligent  system  is  producing  outcomes  that  are  valid,  verified,  data-driven,  trustworthy\r\nand explainable to a layman, ethical in the context of its deployment, unbiased in its learning, and fair to its\r\nusers”  [178].

Figure 2:Six AI assurance goals that are needed for the verification and validation of AI. 4.1    The Farmer-Centered AI (FCAI) Framework\r\nOne  approach  to  achieving  AI  assurance  goals  is  integrating  human  interaction  in  the  AI  lifecycle,  known  as\r\nHuman-centered AI (HCAI), we restructure that and propose a Farmer-Centered AI, or the FCAI framework. In\r\nFCAI, farmers and AI get equal importance compared to the “traditional AI lifecycle”. FCAI focuses on farmers’\r\ninputs,  interactions,  and collaborations while designing,  training,  and evaluating AI [184, 185]. For instance,\r\nUAVs are used in agriculture for different applications such as crop disease detection, making harvest-related\r\ndecisions,  surveillance,  and  predicting  soil  parameters  [186,  187];  but  these  can  bring  different  challenges. Some  of  these  challenges  can  arise  regarding  AI  algorithms  and  farmers’  acceptance. AI  challenges,  such\r\nas  algorithm  generalizability  and  labeled  data  scarcity  depend  on  the  AI  developer  [187],  while  the  farmers’\r\nacceptance  solely  depends  on  them. Jarman  et  al. [188]  reported  that  the  results  generated  from  the  UAVs\r\nshould provide actionable information for agricultural practice, and it is critical to translate these into actionable\r\nsteps in the agriculture lifecycle. This example shows a need for engagement between AI developers and farmers\r\nto  use  AI  appropriately. Thus,  the  involvement  of  farmers  in  this  process  can  empower  and  enable  them  to\r\nfoster ethical, interactive, and contestable use of AI while uncovering underlying biases and limitations [189]. Accordingly,  FCAI  framework  can  provide  a  high  level  of  control  to  farmers  while  achieving  automation  of\r\nthe  agricultural  lifecycle.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="},"4375040b-c47b-492e-ace1-e4e669628f03":{"id_":"4375040b-c47b-492e-ace1-e4e669628f03","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"mp9iky7QIqnuBeM7pHX5wjpaJh0O+N/KnBvmtFA12oA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"700fe7a1-d29c-4c5a-9c3a-a579c0b1bd8e","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"yZU1GZte9R3NJZxdNVBnoufCy6fX9c3SCxPR+bOjHXg="}},"text":"As  noted  by  Shneiderman  [190],  this  approach  can  make  AI  reliable,  safe,  and\r\ntrustworthy for decision-making, benefiting individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.

This is\r\nbecause networks of supply chains and Water & Wastewater Systems (WWS) connect with it. The previous\r\nsections reported vulnerabilities and impact on smart farms, but it has cascading effects that disrupt delivery\r\nto the Food Supply Chain (FSC) [198]. A FSC includes a set of activities, as noted by Nukala et al. [199], a\r\n“farm-to-fork” sequence. This sequence involves farmers, food producers/processors, food quality assessment,\r\nlogistics,  packaging,  warehousing,  and  marketing. Thus,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  FCS  depends  on  the  smart\r\nfarm  to  yield  the  crops  and  animal  products  that  can  be  processed  and  distributed  to  ensure  food  security. Considering the perishable nature of most farm products (before processing) and specific harvest times in the\r\nyear,  there  are  a  lot  of  uncertainties  in  the  operation  of  the  system. This  includes  the  early  links  that  form\r\nthe dependencies on the entire system [14]. To help deal with these uncertainties, the FSCs are also adopting\r\nemerging technologies like IoT and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), making it vulnerable\r\nto  cyberattacks  [200,  201]. Additionally,  attackers  can  attack  the  supply  chain  or  third-party  partners  that\r\nprovide  raw  materials  such  as  fertilizers,  grains,  and  stock  feed  affecting  the  farms  [16]. This  is  the  typical\r\ntechnological trade-off in critical infrastructure:  benefits for better monitoring, logistics, and decision-making\r\nat the cost of opening to data breaches and ransomware. These technologies, however, are adopted throughout\r\nseveral stages of the supply chain. For example, Latino and Menegoli [201] explain that the food and beverage\r\nindustry  is  applying  new  technology  to  the  stages  of  “farming,  transportation,  processing  and  the  packaging\r\nand storage of food products”.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FUdeKFZi7QXk3LSGoPQkrGB7mbCReE7nH7zRagyFRTE="},"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707":{"id_":"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bL9eNu0SvAHMKgcgBAZTZguCzoLjsT2pz0omPJ8cxGE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bbe87340-92f7-4cd9-8013-93014ee80669","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"FUdeKFZi7QXk3LSGoPQkrGB7mbCReE7nH7zRagyFRTE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"Sn/BwiLRHuSsnjAeZqHJiPbYq9AHUqB+q2TdiuJg5ek="}},"text":"In this, each layer has its technological network of interdependencies between\r\ncyber  and  physical  components,  and  then  strung  together,  forming  a  chain  of  dependencies. This  opens  up\r\nthe supply chain to vulnerabilities through cascading effects of cyberattacks at any one stage and potentially\r\nimpacting  later  stages  that  are  secure. For  example,  the  ransomware  attacks  noted  on  food  and  agriculture\r\ncompanies [52, 17, 70, 73, 77, 20] in Section 2 are real examples of this situation. Additionally, the ransomware\r\nattacks on grain companies such as Crystal Valley [73] and NEW Cooperative Inc. [77] interrupted the daily\r\noperations  of  these  companies. This  would  have  affected  the  farmers  because  Minnesota  and  Iowa  are  the\r\nthird and fourth largest producers of crops in the U.S., respectively. Another critical infrastructure sector that impacts agriculture and FSCs is the WWS sector. The WWS\r\nsector is one of the defining areas of critical infrastructure for agriculture because it provides water for irrigation,\r\ncrop cooling, frost control, and pesticide & fertilizer applications [202]. The agricultural water makes it possible\r\nto grow fresh produce and sustain livestock. It has been noted that 37% of the water goes towards irrigation\r\nof  crops,  which  is  the  second  largest  use  of  water  after  thermoelectric  power  production  [203]. Recently,  a\r\ntechnological shift has been observed toward adopting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Systems Control\r\nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) in water systems. These technologies, without appropriate security measures,\r\nmake  the  water  systems  vulnerable  to  cyber  threats  [203,  31,  29]. Considering  more  than  a  third  of  our\r\nwater  supply  is  utilized  for  irrigation,  any  disruptions  in  WWS  cascade  the  impact  on  agriculture,  affecting\r\nfood  security  and  supply  chains.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"puJUz4FwlVdixhGUTYdCIGe0gm89IKlqVxJg430GUh4="},"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f":{"id_":"62591935-6a69-4264-8c4e-28ad51834f4f","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"bL9eNu0SvAHMKgcgBAZTZguCzoLjsT2pz0omPJ8cxGE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"06590a0f-0b10-4c13-b9f8-37f95f3d4707","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"puJUz4FwlVdixhGUTYdCIGe0gm89IKlqVxJg430GUh4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"861024a2-9d17-4a5d-98c0-2f1365aacb84","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"X2buCP3D5x9d940Gdz6s4KM3/RoErJjMovGjxlGd2PQ="}},"text":"Additionally,  a  subtle  change  in  the  chemical  agents  used  in  the  WWS,  for\r\nexample, sodium hydroxide, can change the pH level of the water [204].

Recently,  in  Florida,  an  adversary  tried  to  poison  the  water  by  changing  the  values\r\nof  sodium  hydroxide  in  the  system  [31]. This  happened  due  to  the  compromising  of  credentials.

This  attack  made  some  government  websites  unavailable  for  a  few  hours. As  noted  by  Geiller\r\nand Lee [205], government websites are crucial for efficient public administration, effective public services, and\r\nmaintaining the democratic legitimacy of the government. The government’s agricultural website can provide\r\ndifferent tools for farmers,  which becomes unavailable due to cyberattacks on the government websites. For\r\nexample, farmers.gov1offers local dashboards that provide insightful information on farming data and USDA\r\nresources  for  different  U.S. states. Additionally,  it  offers  different  tools  such  as  farm  loan  assistant  tools,\r\ndisaster assistance discovery tools, and conservation concern tools, which can help farmers in decision-making. Thus, a cyberattack on the government infrastructure, such as websites, could create delays in resource sharing\r\nand serving the country’s agricultural community. 5.2    Food Security, Accessibility & Availability\r\nCybersecurity incidents in the agricultural sector profoundly impact food security.

The incidents reported in this survey\r\nilluminate  the  multifaceted  challenges  in  the  agricultural  sector  to  maintain  operational  integrity. Farm  pro-\r\nduction, food processing, and supply chains are vital to the global food security network, but their connections\r\nwith  emerging  technologies  make  them  vulnerable  to  cyber  threats. This  highlights  the  need  for  heightened\r\nvigilance  and  robust  protective  measures. The  analyzed  cyber  incidents  in  the  agricultural  sector  manifest  a\r\ndiverse array of attack vectors, ranging from ransomware attacks [56, 17, 70, 75, 87] to unauthorized access\r\nthrough compromised credentials [62, 71] and sophisticated hacking techniques [50, 34]. This diversity under-\r\nscores the need for multifaceted security strategies to address a wide spectrum of cyber threats. Notably, these\r\nincidents resulted in substantial disruptions at various nodes within the agricultural supply chain, encompassing\r\nfarm operations [17, 70, 78], processing facilities [75, 92], and distribution [50, 56] networks. It has also been\r\nnoted that these attacks disrupted the communication networks, inventory management, and order fulfillment. This forced companies to apply containment measures, shut down operations, cancel or delay deliveries, and\r\nprioritize outbound shipments for expiring food products. In  the  aftermath  of  cyberattacks  on  the  agricultural  sector,  profound  consequences  impact  essential\r\nfood  availability  and  accessibility. The  cyberattacks  targeting  critical  nodes  within  the  sector,  such  as  meat,\r\ndairy, frozen food, and restaurant supply chains, disrupt the flow of essential food items to consumers. These\r\ndisruptions could occur throughout the entire production and distribution network. It causes shortages in crucial\r\nfood categories compromising the variety and availability of products on store shelves [78, 92].

The CARMA is a risk assessment program led by the DHS, FDA, and USDA, collaborating\r\nwith industry, academia, and government representatives. These initiatives were influenced by insights from the\r\nFood Industry Cybersecurity Summit [208] organized by the Food Protection and Defense Institute (FPDI) and\r\nsupported by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate. In 2016, this summit was held in Washington, D.C.,\r\nand  facilitated  discussions  among  nearly  40  participants  from  the  food  industry,  government,  and  academia.

The agriculture sector is unique and\r\ninteresting since it already faces weather/climate and price risks. That is, Cybersecurity is a third dimension\r\nto risks in the FA sector. The  review  of  cybersecurity  incidents  in  the  paper  indicates  direct  costs  measured  by  these  companies\r\nrange  from  a  few  to$202  million. Much  of  it  is  income  losses  and  disruptions  to  processes,  with  many\r\nother  direct  costs  unaccounted  for,  e.g.,  legal  issues  arising  from  privacy  loss. Thinking  along  the  lines  of\r\nweather/climate  and  price  risks,  the  cybersecurity  attacks  will  have  a  comparable  effect. That  is,  if  the\r\nrisk  is  not  addressed,  attacks  will  result  in  higher  prices  along  the  entire  supply  chain  affecting  consumers,\r\nproducers  (farmers),  processors,  wholesalers,  and  retailers. For  example,  Venkat  and  Masters  [211]  estimate\r\nprice increases of up to 42 percent for fruits, vegetables, dairy, and eggs following storms and droughts. With  squeezed  profitability,  since  the  agriculture  sector  does  not  have  high  pricing  power  (small  and\r\nmedium enterprises), business survival and job stability are the next set of economic challenges. Following up\r\non the storms and drought example, the high prices hurt consumers and do not necessarily benefit farmers and\r\nothers along the supply chain. The latter arises when prices of intermediates, e.g., energy and transportation\r\ncosts,  capture  most  of  the  margin  between  markets  and  production  points  at  the  time  of  weather  events. Additionally,  reputational  damage  and  stock  market  losses  can  make  companies  leave  the  agriculture  sector\r\ndisrupting domestic and global supply chains.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iV9Sq1q93FtfYPUITbivZfVwbwcUy+K4XcqXPHHZoM4="},"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb":{"id_":"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_21","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"IPFRmhV8F/KJ6zMNuXQrUtz+kWp1hx9yLFH6mUqbaxE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a270b820-5fcb-4f52-913f-ff02fe0b7cc9","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"iV9Sq1q93FtfYPUITbivZfVwbwcUy+K4XcqXPHHZoM4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"RGcLtv8ctF42bXzXniT1rkbGzMBHjAgNW11a44tEl3k="}},"text":"With  cybersecurity  risks,  farmers  and  others  along  the  supply  chain  face  significant  uncertainties  in  the\r\nbusiness  environment. On  one  side,  they  ask  whether  or  not  investments  in  cybersecurity  are  worthwhile\r\ngiven their scale, limited pricing power and the public good properties of such systems. Simultaneously, they\r\nrecognize the consequences of an attack (direct and indirect costs). Uncertainties in business environment have\r\nbeen  shown  to  affect  investment,  consumption,  GDP  and  even  trade  among  nations  [212]. A  cybersecurity\r\nrisk management strategy is the need of hour in the agriculture sector, and it will require a public and private\r\npartnership. 5.4    Challenges\r\nThis sub-section discusses the challenges and potential solutions to improve the current state of utilization of\r\nAI in agriculture. Considering this, the three most relevant challenges are:  Data, Deployment, and Adoption. The details of these challenges are as follows. •Data- Data plays a crucial role in developing AI solutions, and it is a significant bottleneck in getting\r\nlabeled  high-quality  data  to  train  AI  models  [213]. Recent  surveys  published  by  Ferrang  et  al. [214]\r\nand Alwis et al. [215] listed different datasets that can be used for different smart farming applications. However, they are not specially obtained from agriculture or smart farms. It is essential to represent the\r\ncharacteristics of agriculture in the data to develop a robust AI solution. This creates a need to obtain\r\nhigh-quality domain-specific datasets. One of the possible solutions to make diverse,  high-quality data\r\navailable is using agriculture testbeds. Recently, Batarseh et al. [216] and Oberascher et al. [217] reported\r\nsoil testbeds that can help to produce agriculture-specific network and sensor data. This approach may\r\nhelp researchers to tackle data quality issues and provide robust AI solutions for agriculture. •Deployment– Deployment of AI solutions in real settings is another challenge observed in the agriculture\r\ndomain. Most security solutions, such as malware, DoS/DDoS detection systems, and intrusion detection\r\nfor UAVs, are not deployed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Vzf+VzZND4L0zrMj3geuRzXXUpBKg4hGDIe6b0sBhNY="},"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac":{"id_":"4019b974-ce4e-492c-ba75-0ba6b4a887ac","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_21","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"IPFRmhV8F/KJ6zMNuXQrUtz+kWp1hx9yLFH6mUqbaxE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"001d75b7-1dd4-423e-a850-75d419d036cb","metadata":{"page_number":21,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"Vzf+VzZND4L0zrMj3geuRzXXUpBKg4hGDIe6b0sBhNY="}},"text":"These security solutions are crucial for detecting and mitigating cybersecurity\r\nthreats  to  farms. The  deployment  of  AI  solutions  can  also  uncover  the  scalability  and  stability  issues\r\nthat may occur while using these solutions. Additionally, issues such as data and model drifts can occur\r\nwith the deployment of models, which also needs attention to use AI as a decision-support tool. •Adoption- The adoption of AI in everyday decision-making for farmers is challenges because it depends\r\non different factors such as personal, social, cultural, and economic [218, 219]. Prokopy et al. [220] noted\r\nthat the education level of farmers, capital, income, farm size, access to information, and environmental\r\nawareness  could  also  affect  adopting  new  technology. In  addition,  the  missing  link  between  AI  and\r\nAI  assurance  could  increase  the  risk  of  using  AI  at  the  farm,  affecting  farmers’  trust,  confidence,  and\r\nsafety. Thus, it is essential to incorporate AI assurance along with the deployment of AI applications and\r\ninvolve farmers in essential steps, as shown in FCAI framework. Further, providing informative sessions\r\non  explaining  the  need  for  AI,  its  use,  and  real-case  scenarios  could  also  help  increase  AI  adoption  in\r\nagriculture. 21","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"RGcLtv8ctF42bXzXniT1rkbGzMBHjAgNW11a44tEl3k="},"003108d1-9884-432b-be5a-b0c6e51f5545":{"id_":"003108d1-9884-432b-be5a-b0c6e51f5545","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf_22","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"jx6/r1WQyrRDdqvVtcxO5TqitBQRt1ShoKblopvWk0Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b0429e73-94aa-4af8-bffa-36ce5abd0644","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf","file_name":"A Review of Cybersecurity Incidents in the Food and Agriculture Sector.pdf"},"hash":"3pKDxaoanVVRu2/39U00Jp6jr6C/rmJRlDqDdpYk1NM="}},"text":"6    Epilogue\r\nThe  30  FA  incidents  reviewed  in  this  survey  spanned  over  11  years,  from  the  Monsanto  data  breach  in  2011\r\nto the Galil Sewage Corporation’s irrigation attack in 2023. Overall, it can be noted that ransomware attacks\r\ncaused  17  incidents  out  of  30,  and  it  is  the  most  common  form  of  attack. This  review  also  describes  four\r\nwidely used CSFs and recent AI-based cybersecurity solutions. These recent solutions reported in the survey are\r\napplications of AI, blockchain, and FL. By providing this analysis, we aspire that the cybersecurity incidents,\r\nalong  with  CSFs  and  AI  solutions,  could  act  as  an  informative  resource  to  guide  respective  stakeholders,\r\nfarmers,  and  policy  makers. Further,  this  survey  introduces  a  new  framework  that  encompasses  the  need\r\nfor  AI  assurance  in  the  agriculture  domain;  it  also  signifies  its  importance  for  the  validation  and  verification\r\nof  AI  overall. The  FCAI  framework  proposed  in  this  survey  incorporates  AI  assurance  in  the  AI  lifecycle  for\r\nagricultural  applications. Thus,  it  is  crucial  for  practitioners  to  consider  such  approaches  and  apply  AI  &\r\nAI  assurance  as  a  part  of  one  farm-to-fork  agricultural  supply  chain. This  discussion  therefore,  is  aimed  at\r\nhelping organizations and policymakers assess the interrelated effects of cyber threats.

The large scale and complexity\r\nof services make them more prone to failure. To maintain services’ normal and stable operation, alert and\r\nincident management (AIM), which analyzes and handles service failures in time, has become an important\r\ncontent of IT service management (ITSM). Many intelligent solutions have been proposed to improve the\r\nmanagement process. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that systematically reviews related\r\nworks. Moreover, no integrated AIM architecture can cover each detailed process or most existing piecemeal\r\nsolutions. Therefore, we conduct an in-depth survey to address these problems. To the best of our knowledge,\r\nthe paper is the most comprehensive survey on intelligent AIM in IT services. Through this survey, we make the\r\nfollowing contributions. First, we summarize an integrated architecture that includes detailed AIM processes\r\nand key techniques. Second, we provide a systematic review of related works based on the architecture. Third,\r\nwe give a valuable analysis of current challenges and trends in AIM. 1. Introduction\r\nWith the progress of Information Technology (IT), IT services have\r\nbecome indispensable in our daily activities, such as online shopping,\r\nsocial networking, and entertainment. Service providers must maintain\r\nthe normal and stable operation of IT services to ensure the quality of\r\nservice (QoS) (Duan et al., 2003).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"68Vf3SFJXtkuEfn1hxCo2LJZbN1YyEY2GEgWq0vwoUg="},"c925562d-8880-4539-86b0-2743c1f21a66":{"id_":"c925562d-8880-4539-86b0-2743c1f21a66","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qOrhhfGqr6xOk7RVUWPRhjlnXsaFOu7NB+7ALU44qW4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"95a40111-1af0-4565-85c0-03a68e86ec5a","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"68Vf3SFJXtkuEfn1hxCo2LJZbN1YyEY2GEgWq0vwoUg="}},"text":"IT service management (ITSM) (Kr-\r\nishnan and Ravindran, 2017) plays a vital role in the daily operations\r\nof IT services, including a set of activities to ensure service level\r\nagreements (SLAs) (Raimondi et al., 2008). With the development of virtualization, cloud, big data, and mi-\r\ncroservice, IT services are becoming more large-scale and complex. Fig. 1 shows an IT service system with numerous components and\r\ncomplex logical relationships (Zhao et al., 2020c). Accordingly, in-\r\ncidents (unplanned interruptions/outages) of the service (Lou et al.,\r\n2013) are usually inevitable. Meanwhile, they could destroy service\r\nquality and incur huge economic losses. For example, Amazon’s one-\r\nhour downtime on Prime Day may lead to the loss of up to $100 million\r\nin sales.1Therefore, incident management (IcM) (Zhou et al., 2017;\r\nChen et al., 2020b) is vital and has become one of the most critical\r\nprocesses in ITSM. At present, many IT service providers have established systems of\r\nalert and incident management (AIM), as shown in  Fig. 2.

Yu et al. Fig.2.Overview of AIM in IT service system. from the service system. Once these monitoring data violate predefined\r\nalerting rules, alerts would be generated to notify engineers to pay\r\nattention to them (Zhao et al., 2020c). Next, alert management is\r\nresponsible for processing numerous raw alerts from the monitoring\r\nsystem and identifyingseverealerts. These severe alerts, as well asuser\r\ncomplaints, are treated asincidents, which are further handled by the\r\nincident management process. The incident management goals are to\r\nassign the incidents to responsible teams, localize the root causes (Solé\r\net al., 2017), and resolve the incidents as soon as possible to ensure\r\nservice stability. Traditionally, manual AIM is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, various solutions (see Section 3.4) have been proposed\r\nto handle alerts and incidents in an automatic and intelligent way. Such a body of works also contributes to the operations paradigm shift\r\nknown as Artificial intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) (Dang et al.,\r\n2019; Notaro et al., 2020; Sabharwal and Bhardwaj, 2022; Rijal et al.,\r\n2022), i.e., utilizing Artificial Intelligence to enhance IT Operations. This study aims to understand AIM by providing a uniform archi-\r\ntecture as well as the latest progress in this area. However, to our\r\nknowledge, no uniform AIM architecture can fully describe each AIM\r\nprocess or comprise most existing piecemeal solutions. In addition,\r\nno thorough AIM survey reviews the state-of-the-art works (see Sec-\r\ntion 3.3). Therefore, we conducted the survey focusing on AIM (as\r\nshown in the red dashed frame of Fig. 2) to tackle these problems. The\r\npaper surveys 89 representative research papers from the last 15 years\r\n(2008–2022) in detail and makes the main contributions as follows. 1. The paper summarizes an integrated AIM architecture that con-\r\nsists of various processes and can cover most existing piecemeal\r\nsolutions. This architecture can help readers have a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the AIM workflow and design and evolve the\r\nmanagement system for industrial purposes. 2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PBM3lt773DLjl7qUKPXsRxb6LMafZenDm0fpyq90pak="},"b0b3e0b9-7780-4bd3-be05-2af15a092a29":{"id_":"b0b3e0b9-7780-4bd3-be05-2af15a092a29","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"CVPb7NrvjUu6XRAnw11XUYnlgnCWcpyYJJB0BEdeSO8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"afdbcea9-c9eb-4908-884d-22c5d4a5c1d3","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"PBM3lt773DLjl7qUKPXsRxb6LMafZenDm0fpyq90pak="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8bec98e0-722b-419f-a080-8f9fa32dc51d","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"nc8KNtS4QmyL/S/bcKQkW51qzgS0ESD+M4J96MCURAk="}},"text":"2.

As shown in Fig. 2, an alert does not necessarily lead to an\r\nincident. Meanwhile, an incident does not necessarily have a reported\r\nalert, e.g., some incidents are reported by user complaints only. In\r\nterms of severity, incidents are usually more severe than alerts, and\r\nalerts are more severe than events in general. Besides, events, alerts,\r\nand incidents can all generate notifications to engineers, depending on\r\nthe specific settings of the organization. 2.3. Rootcauseanalysis\r\nTo completely resolve an incident, experts will analyze the root\r\ncause of it. Traditionally, experts manually investigate root causes\r\nbased on their domain knowledge (e.g., the dependencies between\r\nservice components) and related data analysis (e.g., metrics and logs). However, the manual analysis will cost much time and effort, and is\r\nnot conducive to the quick resolution of incidents. Therefore, many\r\ntechniques have been proposed to improve RCA (łgorzata Steinder and\r\nSethi, 2004; Solé et al., 2017; Soldani and Brogi, 2022).

Yu et al. 2.3.1. Dependencygraphconstruction\r\nThere are two major ways to construct the dependency graph for\r\nroot cause analysis: system architecture analysis and causality discov-\r\nery. The system architecture provides accurate dependencies among\r\ncomponents. For example, call relationships of services or microservices\r\ncan be regarded as dependencies (Kim et al., 2013; Li et al., 2022d,a;\r\nZhang et al., 2021). In this context, if serviceAcalls serviceB, thenA\r\ndepends onB. Thus, the dependency graph can be represented by the\r\ncall graph generated based on sensors deployed on the components. Resource-sharing relationships among components are also dependen-\r\ncies, which can further enhance the dependency graph (Weng et al.,\r\n2018; Wu et al., 2020). For example, if virtual machineAand virtual\r\nmachineBare located at the same physical machine, or serviceA\r\nandBare dependent on the same storage, then they have dependency\r\neven if they do not directly call each other. Besides the coarse-grained\r\nservice-level and virtual machine-level dependencies, traces are utilized\r\nin many approaches (e.g., TraceAnomaly (Liu et al., 2020a), Micro-\r\nRank (Yu et al., 2021), Sage (Gan et al., 2021), TraceRCA (Li et al.,\r\n2021b)) to acquire span-level dependencies. Some other works learn the dependency relationship automatically\r\nfrom the historical monitoring data of the components. The PC al-\r\ngorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000; Kalisch and Bühlman, 2007), a causal\r\nrelationship learning algorithm, is widely used to identify dependencies\r\nin different levels, such as performance metric level (Chen et al.,\r\n2014; Ma et al., 2019, 2020; Meng et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2022),\r\nAPI level (Wang et al., 2018a), alert level (Zhang et al., 2020), and\r\nmicroservice level (Lin et al., 2018a).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lIkxhUwTZ6YZkNVhA7ImXAlELlaEveJrj7RcEvVGAe8="},"d75a737c-0e61-4691-b3a9-c5bbc645e9cd":{"id_":"d75a737c-0e61-4691-b3a9-c5bbc645e9cd","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uSclxjRP8nYarp8sWnyppWUNi6WM8e2FsZHCBgOHvHs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c7ec393a-954c-4f1f-8959-adc52f5efd35","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"lIkxhUwTZ6YZkNVhA7ImXAlELlaEveJrj7RcEvVGAe8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"029120aa-7a0e-4ce9-8de9-78d3ccd34588","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"41ofFwP65xwlzpvB8+9BfKuTaQ6kkDZ266VbcztRBwM="}},"text":"Moreover, the Granger Causality\r\ntests (Granger, 1969) are used to infer component dependencies (Thal-\r\nheim et al., 2017). 2.3.2. Rootcauseinference\r\nAfter constructing the dependency graph, a method is in need to\r\ninfer the root cause based on the dependency graph. Some works (Kim\r\net al., 2013; Weng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018a;\r\nMa et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) assume that the metrics of root-\r\ncause components are similar to those of the affected components. Thus, a random walker aiming to find the root cause should iteratively\r\ngo to the neighbors with higher metric similarity. Therefore, they use\r\nrandom walk (Spitzer, 2013) with metric similarity as the transition\r\nprobability to infer the root cause. Moreover, some works (Chen et al.,\r\n2014; Lin et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2020a, 2021) directly apply a\r\nDepth First Search (DFS) method to find the most upstream abnor-\r\nmal component on the dependency graph.

Methodology\r\nWe collect literature in a snowballing manner (Wohlin, 2014). We\r\nfirst identify 16 seed papers from those published in relevant confer-\r\nences and journals in recent years, including SIGKDD ’17, ICSE ’19–22,\r\nESEC/FSE ’20, ASE ’19–21, and INFOCOM ’20. Then, a keywords-\r\nbased database search (MacDonell et al., 2010) is performed to make\r\nup for the lack of initial literature, using keywords (‘‘alarm’’, ‘‘alert’’,\r\n‘‘incident’’, and ‘‘ticket’’) to search popular online digital libraries (IEEE\r\nXplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer Online, and Elsevier Online). For the paper screening, we comprehensively consider their quality\r\nand relevance to the theme. We notice that many studies are for\r\nnetwork security alerts, which analyze network attacks. As monitoring\r\nsystems for IT services typically generate two types of alerts, i.e., system\r\nalerts (as shown in Table 1) and network alerts indicating the network\r\nperformance and reliability, those network security alert-related works\r\nare out of the topic of this survey. After the search, we extend the list of\r\npapers by recursively examining those referred by or referring to any\r\nincluded one, which also follows the paper screening above.

Yu et al. Fig.5.Illustration of AIM architecture. (see Section 4). Alert correlation reduces the volume of alerts to be\r\nanalyzed and provides more valuable information for current problems,\r\nas the raw alerts are usually massive and contain miscellaneous infor-\r\nmation. Alert storm handling resolves extreme alert storm problems\r\nwhen alert correlation techniques are unavailable or do not work well. Alert determination aims to identify severe alerts for creating incident\r\ntickets, while non-severe alerts are usually ignored. The incident management module is responsible for tackling in-\r\ncident tickets and resolving problems described in the tickets (see\r\nSection 5). Traditionally, incident management includes three stages,\r\ni.e., incident triage, mitigation, and resolution (Chen et al., 2020a). Incident triage is to find the accountable expert (group) for each inci-\r\ndent ticket. After an incident is assigned, the corresponding expert first\r\nperforms mitigation actions quickly to mitigate the incident. Finally,\r\nthe expert explores the root cause and ultimately acts to resolve the\r\nincident based on an in-depth analysis. This process is called inci-\r\ndent resolution. This paper first introduces two building blocks for\r\nautomated ticket analysis, named ticket representation and incident\r\nlinking. Ticket representation transfers textual tickets into structural\r\ndata, while incident linking provides a more informative overview of\r\ncurrent problems to support the three traditional stages. After that,\r\npapers related to the three stages are reviewed respectively. There are three types of roles in the architecture: service users,\r\nOCEs, and experts. If service users encounter issues when using the\r\nservice, user complaints will be sent to the system and become one\r\nof the primary sources of incidents. OCEs, also called system admin-\r\nistrators or operators in some papers, are mainly involved in three\r\nprocesses: alert determination, incident ticket creation, and incident\r\ntriage. Finally, experts, who are also referred to as subject matter\r\nexperts (SMEs) (Gupta et al., 2008a) or service engineers, perform quick\r\nmitigation and final resolution of incidents based on in-depth analysis\r\nof the root causes of incidents as well as some prior knowledge and\r\nexperience. 3.3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pTkF5s7WaLhEscsOgLGgoczXUWkA7e0llOfnUMWyJg8="},"41a1089f-b4dd-4faa-9c11-f35868f1af99":{"id_":"41a1089f-b4dd-4faa-9c11-f35868f1af99","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"0TbDo6aAojDvPAkmVXFarryMQQJfzkos4+yNKeSd7x4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f52940e1-9347-43d6-9ba7-e38090efbc4f","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"pTkF5s7WaLhEscsOgLGgoczXUWkA7e0llOfnUMWyJg8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"008acf6b-d644-4a54-8a57-0f28d41cfe4c","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"0ezaZegIcw9Vp7VJDrP29k+ZcRwLJA3zoh1oQus+3Z0="}},"text":"3.3.

Alertmanagement\r\nAs shown in Fig. 5, alert management is responsible for identifying\r\nsevere alerts from raw alerts generated by the monitoring system for\r\ncreating incident tickets. However, the raw alerts are challenging to\r\nanalyze due to large numbers, false alerts, etc. In order to solve the\r\nproblem of alerts’ large volume, some works correlate raw alerts to\r\nreduce the effort to analyze alerts and provide concise information to\r\ndescribe current alerting problems. We categorize these works as the\r\ncontent ofalertcorrelation. Nevertheless, as many service environments\r\ndo not apply alert correlation technologies or the technologies do not\r\nalways work, extreme situations called alert storms sometimes occur. So some works focus on handling alert storms. We categorize these\r\nworks as the content ofalert storm handling. Last but not least, it\r\nis necessary to determine whether alerts are severe and need to be\r\nresolved. Traditionally, these tasks are done manually by OCEs, which\r\nis inefficient. Therefore, some automated methods are proposed. We\r\ncategorize these works as the content ofalertdetermination. 4.1. Alertcorrelation\r\nThe number of raw alerts is usually huge, but each alert contains\r\nonly a little information that cannot provide an overview of the cur-\r\nrent problems. To tackle this problem, alert correlation techniques are\r\nproposed to alleviate alert analysis pressure and provide more practical\r\ninformation to describe current issues. In the intrusion detection system (IDS), two types of works can\r\neffectively reduce the effort of analyzing alerts by integrating alerts,\r\ni.e., alert aggregation and alert correlation. In this context, alert ag-\r\ngregation identifies and clusters different alerts belonging to a specific\r\nattack instance. Alert correlation is to link the alerts from the same\r\nattack process together to rebuild the attack course (Chengpo et al.,\r\n2006). However, current alert indicators in IT services are much more\r\nthan the previous intrusion attacks, and there is no clear boundary\r\nbetween alert aggregation and alert correlation as their goals are the\r\nsame. Moreover, similar works are called alert fusion (Zang et al., 2008)\r\nin some literature.

Therefore, feature se-\r\nlection is often one basic and important step in many alert analysis\r\nworks. Traditional feature selection is usually made manually based\r\non knowledge and experience, which may not be accurate enough. A further approach is to use feature engineering (Kuhn and Johnson,\r\n2019) for this task (Asres et al., 2020). Moreover, Alhaj et al. (2016)\r\nproposed a 2-tier feature selection method for improving attribute-\r\nbased alert correlation, which automatically selects appropriate and\r\nsignificant features using Information Gain. Attribute-based methods are most commonly used for the network\r\n(security) alert correlation because alerts with the same source IP\r\naddress, target IP address, port, etc., are significantly related. For ex-\r\nample, a probabilistic strategy (Valdes and Skinner, 2001) is presented\r\nto correlate alerts based on the similarity of their overlapping attributes\r\nwithout considering their unique attributes. Besides, Man et al. (2012)\r\nproposed a clustering algorithm that iteratively calculates the average\r\nvalue of classes as the new clustering center based on random selection,\r\nmerging, and dividing dynamically. For the correlation of service alerts, Lin et al. (2014) proposed a\r\nhierarchical clustering method to correlate alerts based on the text. Specifically, it first represents each alert as a bag of words and creates a\r\ndistance matrix based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques,\r\nand uses the Jaccard distance metric to compare any two alerts. Then,\r\nalerts are clustered based on the distance matrix using a graph-theoretic\r\napproach which uses connected component detection to generate initial\r\nclusters before applying the graph-cut algorithm to further refine the\r\nclusters. But a purely attribute-based method tends to be less effective\r\nbecause correlating the alerts of the same service, device, etc., is too\r\nrudimentary. Besides, correlating alerts based on other attributes, such\r\nas the alert key, lacks reasonable explanations, as the alerts of similar\r\nindicators in different services or components are not necessarily re-\r\nlated. Therefore, few studies correlate service alerts only based on the\r\nsimilarity of service alert attributes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"hnqknIsENZmYmGXVwUM8RyokArHER6p1wZHNW2rGBYg="},"0996a1ec-5e6b-4e8c-a0c1-69d0b34204fd":{"id_":"0996a1ec-5e6b-4e8c-a0c1-69d0b34204fd","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"60N8q0Ljgbc7n6Xtbj5RIlyrueqMq6Mz2KEPIE2ZboA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0a652f7f-c5ad-42ae-989d-6d769187d42b","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"hnqknIsENZmYmGXVwUM8RyokArHER6p1wZHNW2rGBYg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"69cc1b67-da87-43c4-a95a-0434dc1cfbb6","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"L5VJL6ppcFLAvOEbTSiyWflL2uaE7yO3Ea0GDztwmP4="}},"text":"Therefore, few studies correlate service alerts only based on the\r\nsimilarity of service alert attributes. 4.1.2. Dependency-basedmethods\r\nDependency-based methods mainly use various known or learned\r\ndependencies among alerts to correlate them. Early solutions use prede-\r\nfined static rules to correlate alerts, where the rules are mainly gained\r\nfrom experience and knowledge. Further, some works (e.g., Mannila\r\nand Toivonen (1996)) try to mine frequent sequence patterns from alert\r\nsequences, which can be used as correlation rules to correlate alerts. But\r\nthese rules are pre-learned or predefined and cannot adapt to changes\r\nin the environment, which are not intelligent enough. Therefore, Costa\r\net al. (2009) proposed a smart and adaptive alert correlation architec-\r\nture, which uses a rule discovery approach to generate the rules based\r\non alerts and incident tickets. In particular, the approach is independent\r\nof the network topology and uses incident ticket information to get\r\nfeedback from the correlation results based on an association rule\r\nalgorithm. However, in modern large-scale service systems, service compo-\r\nnents are numerous and have complex dependencies. A failure of\r\none component may cause a series of alerts.

The core of these works is to find the de-\r\npendencies. Thus some dependency learning methods in Section 2.3.1\r\ncan be used to achieve this goal.

Besides, some statistical approaches are\r\nadopted to learn the dependencies of alerts, such as Pearson correlation\r\ncoefficient (Mahimkar et al., 2009) and Granger causality (Yin and\r\nYao, 2016). But Pearson correlation coefficient cannot discover the\r\nnon-linear or non-functional relationships amongst alerts, and Granger\r\ncausality assumes the lags between two alerts are stable, which does\r\nnot always hold in IT service alerts.

Summary\r\nAlert correlation techniques mainly have two application scenarios. One is correlating real-time alerts to provide intuitive and effective\r\ninformation reflecting current problems. Another is correlating cur-\r\nrent alerts with similar historical alerts for using historical handing\r\ninformation to analyze current issues. As mentioned earlier, attribute-\r\nbased methods combine multiple attributes to correlate alerts, which\r\ncan uncover associations that are challenging to find with dependent-\r\nbased methods. These methods can work for both two scenarios. How-\r\never, the interpretability of these methods is lacking. In contrast, the\r\ndependency-based methods are more interpretable as they correlate\r\nalerts using the dependency relationships of alerts or their components\r\nand indicators. Moreover, the dependencies can provide engineers with\r\nmore intuitive and practical information to analyze current problems. But dependency-based methods mainly work for the first scenario as\r\nthey cannot correlate similar alerts. Hybrid methods combine alert\r\nattributes and dependencies. Thus they should be more effective, fitting\r\nboth two scenarios. But they usually require large and comprehensive\r\nlabeled data, which are challenging to obtain. 4.2. Alertstormhandling\r\nIn real-world ITSM, the alert number sometimes far exceeds what\r\nengineers can handle. Such an extreme situation is called thealertstorm. As a real and ubiquitous phenomenon in the IT service environment,\r\nthe alert storm has become one major pain point in the current alert\r\nmanagement. Why do alert storms occur?The alert storm occurs mainly due to\r\nthe large scale and complexity of the service system (e.g., Fig. 1). On\r\nthe one hand, the failures of common components used by multiple\r\nservices cause these services to be affected and many alerts generated. On the other hand, the propagation of failures between related compo-\r\nnents further exacerbates the generation of alerts. Intuitively, the alert\r\ncorrelation can effectively handle alert storms by correlating relevant\r\nalerts to reduce the analysis effort. However, since the alert correlation\r\nmethods are not used in some service environments, or the actual\r\neffectiveness of these methods is not ideal, alert storms still occur.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ywmc+X78TPhKbObLb6URxIOggijFhomIn3hEPkODCUk="},"79c123be-4d75-43af-8522-440d424d7bb4":{"id_":"79c123be-4d75-43af-8522-440d424d7bb4","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"D6o/qae53IPLEn2oy7vRdwn50uMxpQ0dTK2NKmEPpLA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a5f51d54-01b9-47c0-948f-95334bc1f6db","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"ywmc+X78TPhKbObLb6URxIOggijFhomIn3hEPkODCUk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"425613a1-2297-4fbf-b157-058cad8591a6","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"IdpE38tFENNH9TOLoJNYCeGbym8YPdkcArh9MKtl4zs="}},"text":"4.2.1.

Some previous standards,\r\nsuch as ISA 18.2 (International Society of Automation (ISA), 2009) and\r\nEEMUA 191 (Equipment and Association, 1999), suggest identifying\r\nthe alert flood when the alerting rate is higher than ten alerts per\r\n10 min per operator (Ahmed et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017).

Networkalertstorm\r\nIn a network alert management system in about 2011, Yang et al. (2011) found that memory depletion of the system is not caused by a\r\nhigh alert arrival rate but by excessive system process delays. When\r\nthe system is required to maintain a state of alerts, it needs to keep\r\nsome alert information describing ongoing transactions of these alerts\r\nfor a certain period. In such a case, all memory may be occupied and\r\nunable to process new alerts. They explored an approach to managing\r\nthe network alert storm by calculating inter-process latency, which\r\nis the time alerts spend waiting to be handled, based on dynamic\r\nstates of alerts and behaviors of system performance. It provides QOS\r\ntrending projection functionality of inter-process latency to manage\r\nCPU and memory capacity and to trigger the control mechanism to\r\nprotect system resources. However, system resources are usually not the\r\nbottleneck in the current alert management system. The main challenge\r\nis that operators cannot identify real issues that need to be addressed\r\nfrom the alert storm. For network security alert storms, Landauer et al. (2022) presented\r\na framework for automatic and domain-independent alert aggregation,\r\nwhich does not need specific alert formats. The approach mainly con-\r\nsists of rule-based algorithms that group alerts by occurrence times,\r\ncluster these groups by similarity, and extract commonalities to model\r\nmeta-alerts without merging all considered alerts into a single common\r\nformat. Based on these metrics and techniques, they proposed an\r\nincremental procedure for generating abstract alert patterns that enable\r\ncontinuous classification of incoming alerts. As a result, the approach\r\ntransforms alerts generated by IDS into higher-level meta-alerts that\r\nrepresent specific attack patterns.

Alertdetermination\r\nIn many IT service systems, especially business-sensitive services\r\n(such as digital banking), the monitoring systems report all suspicious\r\nalerts that may affect the systems’ normal operations to avoid miss-\r\ning potential incidents. This way causes reporting many false alerts\r\nor low-priority alerts that cost much effort to handle. Even if some\r\norganizations optimize the alerting rules as much as possible, false\r\nalerts and missed alerts still abound. Alert determination is to identify\r\nreal alerts or problems that need to be ticketed for subsequent handling\r\nfrom many alerts. Traditionally, the alert determination is manually\r\ndone by OCEs. Unfortunately, manual analysis leads to low efficiency. Sometimes the alerts even exceed what OCEs can properly investi-\r\ngate (Hassan et al., 2019). Therefore, some automated methods were\r\nproposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the manual\r\nway. These methods can be divided into three types:alertdistinguishing,\r\nwhich determines whether an alert is real;severe alert identification,\r\nwhich discovers a few critical alerts from many alerts; andalert-based\r\nincidentidentification, which identifies incidents from a group of alerts. 4.3.1. Alertdistinguishing\r\nAlert distinguishing methods identify the authenticity of each alert. Tang et al.

Yu et al. 5.1. Incidentrepresentation\r\nRepresenting the incident ticket text as a numeric form that subse-\r\nquent methods can use is the basis of the automated analysis. Ticket\r\nrepresentation typically starts from textual featurization, in which the\r\nticket content is divided into features (Diao et al., 2009). The typical\r\nway represents the ticket text as a bag of words divided based on\r\nspace or symbols. Then, these words are transformed into a vector\r\nspace model for subsequent analysis. However, the raw text of tickets\r\nis challenging to use. Correspondingly, some methods are used to solve\r\nexisting challenges. The main challenges and solutions are as follows. •The descriptive text manually recorded may have many vari-\r\nations. First, spelling errors are common and unavoidable. So\r\nsome spelling correction techniques (Hládek et al., 2020) can be\r\nused. Second, a word may have different forms (e.g., different\r\ntenses and voices, singular and plural). Hence, some stemming\r\ntechniques (Moral et al., 2014; Singh and Gupta, 2017) can be\r\napplied, such as Porter’s algorithm (Porter, 1980), which is one\r\nof the most classic stemming techniques. Third, some synonyms\r\nand compound terms may affect analysis results. Hence, syn-\r\nonym detection and compound term processing techniques can\r\nbe used (Shimpi et al., 2014; Yu, 2008). •The words on tickets have different parts of speech. Building Part-\r\nOf-Speech (POS) tags for the words is important for text analysis. To solve this challenge, some NLP methods, such as Stanford\r\nPOS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003; Toutanova and Manning,\r\n2000), are used to identify the nouns, verbs, etc., in the ticket\r\ntext (Agarwal et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). •Some words are meaningless and even adversely affect the subse-\r\nquent analysis. These words are regarded as stopwords. Filtering\r\nout stopwords is essential. Many works manually define stop-\r\nwords based on domain knowledge.

They sorted all words in descending order\r\nof total count and chose the top k words as stopwords. In addition, Tang et al. (2013a) proposed a representation method\r\nfor monitoring tickets based on attribute-based features, including\r\ncategorical features (e.g., hostname, process name), numeric features\r\n(e.g., CPU utilization, disk free space percentage), and textual features\r\n(e.g., incident description). Zhou et al. (2015b) and Zhou et al. (2016) found that using semantic features to represent monitoring\r\ntickets was better than using attribute-level features. They proposed\r\na feature extraction approach to represent ticket information using\r\ntopic-level features obtained via the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\r\nmodel (Blei et al., 2003).

Chen et al. (2021) proposed GRLIA, an incident aggregation framework\r\nbased on graph representation learning. GRLIA comprises two incident\r\nlinking methods. In the offline analysis phase, the first method links the\r\nincidents that may be triggered by each individual failure based on a\r\nwell-known community detection algorithm called Louvain algorithm. Then an embedding vector is learned for different types of incidents by\r\nleveraging existing graph representation learning models. In the online\r\nincident linking phase, the second method employs the learned incident\r\nrepresentation to link incidents by considering their cosine similarity\r\nand topological distance. 5.2.3. Supervisedlearningbasedmethods\r\nThese methods use supervised learning methods to link incidents. Xu et al. (2020) proposed a multi-view similarity measure framework\r\nto integrate several kinds of existing similarity measures, including\r\nsurface matching based, semantic-based, and syntax-based measures. A supervised method is used to determine the similarity threshold\r\nscore for each measure. In particular, they used a machine learning\r\nbased policy to integrate various similarity measures in a more gen-\r\neral way, which makes the framework flexible and extensible. Chen\r\net al.

Incidenttriage\r\nIncident triage is to find a suitable expert (group) for an incident\r\nticket to solve it. Traditionally, OCEs manually finish this task, re-\r\nquiring specific domain knowledge to identify where the problem lies,\r\ne.g., database, storage, and network. However, it is challenging for\r\nOCEs to master various domain knowledge. Furthermore, IT services’\r\nlarge scale and complexity increase the challenge as needing many\r\nexpert groups responsible for different system components.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vyJrfLrWPJN12aGA/juELFILbo1vr/Ij8FUmCgPW3Qc="},"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3":{"id_":"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qsb1rxB5Bbe2jt5LxdaDWe4D8XqPfmyZzExPO5T8lBg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"54bd3e32-ecb7-46a9-bccc-cd3c688bb64e","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"vyJrfLrWPJN12aGA/juELFILbo1vr/Ij8FUmCgPW3Qc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"vDiU/YY2vppH6tFc/szCIaJr/SH5x+A/xpo2m3b2NLU="}},"text":"So the\r\nmanual way is usually inefficient, costing much time and human effort. Therefore, some automated methods have been proposed to improve\r\nefficiency and effectiveness from two perspectives, i.e., automating\r\nticket triage and providing auxiliary information to OCEs to help triage. 5.3.1. Automatedtriagemethods\r\nThe goal of automated triage is to automatically find the correct\r\nexperts for tickets. Ticket triage can also be regarded as one content\r\nof expert recommendation, which is also known as expert finding,\r\nexpert retrieval, or expert search. However, expert recommendation\r\nfar exceeds the field of ticket triage, and there are many related\r\nworks (Nikzad-Khasmakhi et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2017; Yuan et al.,\r\n2020). Correspondingly, this section introduces only the works on the\r\nticket triage field. We summarize various related works based on the\r\nfeatures they use (see Table 6). Content-based Methods.The content-based methods deal with\r\nticket triage only using the text information of tickets, considering\r\nhistorical tickets contain associations between experts and ticket de-\r\nscriptions. Most of these works Agarwal et al. (2012), Dasgupta et al. (2014) and Zeng et al. (2014) consider ticket triage as a text classifi-\r\ncation problem. Godbole and Roy (2008) and Agarwal et al. (2012)\r\nsuggested the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Joachims, 1998) to\r\nbe generally superior to some other technologies, such as decision\r\ntrees, Bayesian networks, and K-means, in this field. Accordingly, SVM\r\nbecame a widely used classifier for ticket triage. Agarwal et al. (2012)\r\nused two attributes (i.e., description and resolution group) of historical\r\nmanual tickets to train a classifier for resolution groups based on the\r\ncombination of SVM and a discriminative term based approach. Then\r\nthe classifier can predict the most appropriate resolution group for a\r\nnew ticket. Dasgupta et al. (2014) presented an approach that com-\r\nprised a correlation model and a classification model.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"I3ho1jXX7Eb/bvMfC3i4iqsbmq0ZhRoCt19LEltUqg4="},"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497":{"id_":"a9bc7324-55e8-4c05-81a6-2ccd2da70497","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qsb1rxB5Bbe2jt5LxdaDWe4D8XqPfmyZzExPO5T8lBg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bacf922c-016f-407e-a6b6-2bf64cf8fef3","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"I3ho1jXX7Eb/bvMfC3i4iqsbmq0ZhRoCt19LEltUqg4="}},"text":"(2014) presented an approach that com-\r\nprised a correlation model and a classification model.

In practice, the group that can resolve\r\nan incident may be very different from the current group, such as the\r\ndatabase group and network group. Therefore, one-time assignment\r\nmethods are not the best for reassignments. Due to the service system’s large scale and complexity, an incident\r\nticket’s dispatching process may involve multiple expert groups and\r\nform a routing sequence until it reaches the expert who can handle\r\nit. The ticket routing sequence describes a ticket dispatch’s complete\r\nprocesses, and each process represents one expert’s actions that handle\r\nthe incident. Considering the fact that historical routing sequences\r\nprovide rich information about the relationship between experts, some\r\nworks (Shao et al., 2008b,a; Miao et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014)\r\ncomplete ticket reassignments utilizing only the routing information. The methods are called sequence-based methods. Shao et al. (2008b,a) developed EasyTicket, a ticket routing rec-\r\nommendation tool which comprises a Markov model to capture the\r\ntransfer decisions from historical resolution sequences and a search al-\r\ngorithm to generate transfer recommendations without accessing ticket\r\ncontent. Some other works (Miao et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014) take\r\nrouting sequences as collaborative networks, a particular type of social\r\nnetwork formed by participants who collectively achieve specific goals,\r\nsuch as fixing software bugs and resolving incidents. Miao et al. (2012)\r\nproposed a network model to simulate real collaborative networks and\r\na routing model to simulate human collaboration dynamics. This model\r\ncan jointly simulate the structure and the ticket routing procedure. In contrast, Sun et al. (2014) directly inferred the routing models in\r\nreal collaborative networks without simulating a collaborative network. More specifically, they formalized multiple routing patterns into a\r\ngenerative model to formulate experts’ routing decisions. Hybrid Methods.Hybrid methods deal with the triage tasks by\r\nutilizing multiple information (e.g., ticket content, routing sequence,\r\nand expert ability). Some works Sun et al.

As the third one is globally optimized, it should\r\nperform better than the first two. In contrast to the supervised methods above, Botezatu et al. (2015)\r\nused an unsupervised learning method to handle ticket triage tasks. More specifically, they first proposed a multi-view clustering method to\r\ncluster the tickets into categories that both reflect the ticketed problems\r\nand are homogeneous in the duration time for an expert to solve them\r\nduring an expert’s solving process. Then they devised a data-informed\r\npolicy that assigns an incoming ticket to the expert who was the fastest\r\nin resolving it. In addition, Zeng et al. (2017) improved their method in Zeng et al.

To solve these\r\ntwo challenges, they proposed DeepCT, a GRU-based model with a\r\nrevised loss function and an attention-based mask strategy. DeepCT\r\ntakes the following data as its input: the incident attributes (titles\r\nand summaries), environment information (monitor ID, related devices,\r\nand how the incidents are reported), and the discussions (textual\r\ninformation written by engineers in an incremental manner).

Yu et al. 5.4. Incidentmitigation\r\nAfter a ticket is assigned, experts shall mitigate the incident quickly. Traditionally, experts try different mitigation actions (e.g., reboot the\r\nserver, replace the faulty hardware, or expand the hardware capacity)\r\nbased on their domain knowledge and analysis. However, manual anal-\r\nysis and mitigation exploration consume much time and prolong inci-\r\ndent recovery time. Thus, some researchers are committed to speeding\r\nup the mitigation process. In some organizations, experts record practical mitigation steps\r\nfor specific incidents. For example, experts of Microsoft record docu-\r\nments describing mitigation processes named troubleshooting guides\r\n(TSGs) (Jiang et al., 2020). Jiang et al. (2020) found incidents could\r\noccur repeatedly and TSGs could be reused to facilitate incident miti-\r\ngation. Therefore, they proposed an automated TSG recommendation\r\napproach, DeepRmd, leveraging the textual similarity between inci-\r\ndent description and its corresponding TSG based on deep learning\r\ntechniques. Intuitively, some incident linking methods in Section 5.2\r\ncan also find the best TSGs for current incidents by linking them with\r\nsimilar historical incidents. Furthermore, some works intend to provide automated solutions\r\nfor incident mitigation. Wu et al. (2012) proposed NetPilot, a system\r\nto automatically mitigate data center network failures by performing\r\nsimple actions, such as deactivating or restarting suspected failure\r\ncomponents. NetPilot circumvents the need for finding the exact root\r\ncause of a failure by taking an intelligent trial-and-error approach. NetPilot identifies a set of components that are likely to cause a prob-\r\nlem and iteratively takes mitigation actions targeting each one until\r\nthe problem is alleviated. The core of NetPilot comprises an impact\r\nestimator that helps prevent overly disruptive mitigation actions and a\r\nfailure-specific mitigation planner that minimizes the number of trials. Wang et al. (2018b) defined and formalized the automation recom-\r\nmendation procedure as a multiarmed bandit problem with dependent\r\narms.

Second, the ticket summaries and\r\nresolutions may be noisy, especially for manual tickets, so the non-\r\ninformative words lead to a low Jaccard similarity score of tickets\r\nwith similar resolutions, making Jaccard similarity function inappro-\r\npriate (Wang et al., 2017). Some works use several techniques to alleviate the first problem by\r\nutilizing semantic information for the similarity measure. Kang et al. (2010) presented a knowledge-rich similarity measure to automati-\r\ncally discover the most similar historical incidents for a new incident. This measure incorporates three types of information, i.e., incident\r\ndescription, expert groups, and incident classification, to improve the\r\ncapability of similarity measurement. Moreover, this measure exploits\r\nas much semantic knowledge as possible about various information\r\ncontained in previous incidents. Zhou et al. (2015b, 2016) proposed\r\ntwo approaches to improve the method in Tang et al. (2013a). On the\r\none hand, considering the resolutions often contain important infor-\r\nmation about incidents, they proposed a feature extraction approach\r\ncapable of representing both the descriptions and resolutions using\r\ntopic-level features obtained via the LDA model. On the other hand,\r\nconsidering that the effectiveness of KNN heavily relies on the under-\r\nlying similarity measurement, they improved similarity measurement\r\nusing metric learning. Zhou et al. (2015a) found out that vocabu-\r\nlaries used in ticket descriptions are changing and shifting over time,\r\nbut interesting mappings exist in those vocabularies. Then, they pro-\r\nposed a ticket resolution recommendation approach that accommodates\r\nvocabularies changing or shifting with time, based on a structural\r\ncorrespondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm. The aforementioned methods deal with only semantically similar\r\nwords without handling the noise caused by non-informative words. To\r\naddress the second problem, Wang et al. (2017) presented a domain-\r\nspecific approach to extract useful phrases to improve the resolution\r\nrecommendation. The approach is based on ontology modeling that can\r\nenhance the semantic understanding of tickets and de-noise tickets by\r\nfiltering non-informative words.

They conducted the data analysis to inspect the\r\nimpact and importance of different server attributes (i.e., hardware\r\nand OS type, hardware age, OS currency, as well as CPU and memory\r\nutilization) on the rates of server failures based on a large set of\r\nincident tickets and server attribute data. Then they summarized the\r\nkey conclusions, e.g., the hardware type and age highly impact server\r\nunavailability. These findings can further be used to derive guidelines\r\nfor technology refresh decisions of the data center. Giurgiu et al. (2014) conducted a large-scale study to analyze the\r\nfactors affecting the labor effort necessary to solve server incidents. The\r\nfactors include various incident features (i.e., the root cause, severity\r\nand complexity of the problem, the assigned support team, and the time\r\nshift when the incident is being resolved) and corresponding server\r\nfeatures (i.e., the machine age and architecture, as well as the OS type\r\nand currency). The results show that the nature of the incidents and\r\ntheir complexity, the assigned support groups, as well as the underlying\r\nOS type play a major role in how much labor effort is spent on resolving\r\nsuch tickets.

They also developed an industrial system based\r\non a set of data-driven techniques, addressing several significant chal-\r\nlenges in IcM practice, such as large-volume data, complex problem\r\nspace, and incomplete domain knowledge. Some works of Microsoft have analyzed incident characteristics\r\nfrom various perspectives. Chen et al. (2020a) analyzed incidents from\r\n18 online service systems and found that many incidents are incidental\r\nincidents, which do not matter and do not need to be fixed with\r\na high priority. Moreover, the incidental incidents are large-volume\r\nand cost much effort. So it is crucial to identify incidental incidents\r\nfor IcM effort reduction. Accordingly, they proposed a deep learning\r\nbased approach to prioritize incidents and find incidental incidents. Chen et al. (2020c) analyzed incident tickets from six core services\r\nin Microsoft, divided into four priorities (i.e., low, medium, high, and\r\ncritical). They found that (1) incidents with lower priority (low and\r\nmedium) are much more than incidents with higher priority (high\r\nand critical); (2) high-layer services (i.e., compute, database, and web\r\nservice) may have hierarchical root causes, which increases problem\r\nsearch space and incident fixing time; (3) network issue with hardware\r\nfailure and human error with code defect are the two major root causes\r\nfor all incidents. From the above descriptions, we can see that Microsoft usually\r\ntreats all alerts as incidents, so most of their works are claimed to focus\r\non analyzing incidents but not alerts, as shown in Table 4. In contrast,\r\nthis paper separates alert management and incident management. On\r\nthe one hand, it provides a more intuitive perspective to present each\r\nprocess and related works.

Mainchallenges\r\nWe summarize several major challenges in AIM as follows. 1.Large-volume and multi-source alerts.As shown in Fig. 1,\r\nlarge-scale IT service systems are complicated because of numer-\r\nous components and complex logical relationships (Zhao et al.,\r\n2020c). Alerts are multi-source as they can come from various\r\nindicators of each component at different levels. Moreover, a\r\nproblem of an individual component may affect a series of\r\ncomponents and their indicators (Jiang et al., 2011). Therefore,\r\nthe number of alerts may be enormous and far exceed what\r\nengineers can investigate manually (Tang et al., 2012).

This heterogeneity of incident tickets makes ticket\r\nanalysis more challenging. 4.Complex incident handling environments.Due to the com-\r\nplexity of services, multiple expert groups are needed to main-\r\ntain different service components (Chen et al., 2019b), such\r\nas networks, databases, and middleware.

Furthermore, although we concatenate the existing individual works\r\nof each module in our architecture (Fig. 2), these works still require\r\nhuman intervention. Alert correlation is a significant improvement\r\nin reducing manual analysis pressure. However, the results of alert\r\ncorrelation still need manual analysis to determine whether/how to\r\ncreate tickets.

Yu et al. 7.3.1. Optimizealertgeneration\r\nImprovealertgenerationbasedontheanalysisresultsofalerts\r\nand tickets.False/missed alerts, which cost much manual effort to\r\nhandle, are widespread in daily ITSM. On the one hand, it is because\r\nalert rules may not dynamically fit frequent fluctuations in the usage\r\nof IT services. On the other hand, originally suitable methods may be\r\ninapplicable as the service systems evolve. Thus, the alert generation\r\nneeds to be continuously optimized. As false/missed alerts often indicate inappropriate alerting rules,\r\noptimizing alerting generation based on the analysis results of alerts\r\nand tickets is very practical and valuable. But existing works mainly\r\nfocus on analyzing alerts after the alerts are generated. Only a few\r\nworks focus on optimizing alerting rules based on alert and incident\r\nanalysis. Tang et al. (2012) optimized alerting rules based on the\r\noffline analysis of historical alerts and the matching tickets, where\r\npotential monitoring conditions are built on a set of predictive rules\r\nautomatically generated by a rule-based learning algorithm with cov-\r\nerage, confidence, and rule complexity criteria. They also presented an\r\nintegrated framework to reduce false and missed alerts for an automatic\r\nmonitoring system (Tang et al., 2013c), mainly based on the finding\r\nthat many false-positive alerts were transient and could be cleared\r\nautomatically by waiting for some minutes. In fact, some existing techniques already provide support to op-\r\ntimize alerting rules. For example, some alert determination meth-\r\nods in Section 4.3 can identify false/non-severe alerts, which can\r\nbe further analyzed to optimize alerting rules. Identifying incidental\r\nincidents (Chen et al., 2020a) can help reduce false-positive alerts. Discovering manual tickets not reported by the monitoring system (Xu\r\net al., 2016) can help reduce missed alerts. Tang et al. (2013b) apply\r\na text classification model to analyze manual ticket descriptions and\r\nidentify the corresponding system issues, aiming to identify missed\r\nmonitoring alerts based on manual tickets.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"a4xHk3CtAf957KtLNNt0yhyFhxr7TVqyFAMgjhMSGys="},"5d5e4be9-0c70-45a4-8703-b8a50a0d2eab":{"id_":"5d5e4be9-0c70-45a4-8703-b8a50a0d2eab","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"9+0AnqDjBLbWQYY+a8Tab2KVbGN8sUxUhGAH4r9kkjI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"54debd09-7206-45ca-a8aa-3ca90bceabad","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"a4xHk3CtAf957KtLNNt0yhyFhxr7TVqyFAMgjhMSGys="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"819a0920-7d40-4dcf-adf3-7e61d56fa265","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"Z3uRnLzEUuUl4H78MhvLfGyuEZegQk0037/3Qb2PvHw="}},"text":"Moreover, some frequent or\r\nperiodic false alerts can be found by combining time sequence analysis\r\nmethods (Elfeky et al., 2005; Puech et al., 2019).

Although resolution recommenda-\r\ntion can help resolve current incidents, completing incident mitigation\r\nand resolution still costs much manual effort. Action recommendation\r\nsteps forward with more intelligent suggestions. While executing scripts\r\ncreated by experts achieves automatic mitigation in certain scenar-\r\nios (Wang et al., 2018b). More methods with more intelligence are still\r\nin need to reduce human effort and accelerate incident mitigation and\r\nresolution. 7.3.4. Develop/improveAIOpsframeworkforAIM\r\nAIOps, as one of the most important developments in service as-\r\nsurance in the last few years, has been commonly used in the trans-\r\nformation of modern service management systems. In general, most\r\nmodern AIM follow the AIOps strategies. As a result, some AIOps\r\nframeworks (Chen et al., 2020c; Li et al., 2022c; Gaikwad et al., 2021)\r\nfor AIM have been proposed in the literature. Besides, various AIOps\r\nproducts (e.g., moogsoft13) have been used in daily IT service opera-\r\ntions. They use many AIOps techniques to improve AIM performance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aFoySJmPeWFVks7X4Q6RB5tQYqvcG2TVfXa7c3oYkPg="},"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d":{"id_":"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3821dfea-3815-4d21-b9f9-113cc337eb1a","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"aFoySJmPeWFVks7X4Q6RB5tQYqvcG2TVfXa7c3oYkPg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="}},"text":"They use many AIOps techniques to improve AIM performance. In contrast, the techniques in our architecture seem to be the most\r\nsystematic and comprehensive. Our architecture can help improve the\r\nprocessing flow of the AIOps framework, and the technologies in each\r\nprocess can help improve the corresponding module. We believe this\r\nsurvey can facilitate the development of AIOps AIM systems. Besides, some works (e.g., Chen et al., 2022a; Arain et al., 2022) fo-\r\ncus on the efficiency of collaboration between operations roles because\r\nmultiple roles are required to view and process alerts and incidents\r\nfor large-scale IT service systems. These roles may have different duty\r\ntimes, current workloads, abilities, experiences, etc. Therefore, the op-\r\ntimization of role collaboration is required for the operations of large-\r\nscale service systems. But the related works are not much introduced\r\nin our survey. 7.4. Relatedtechnologies\r\nThis paper is a survey of research papers on the topic of AIM,\r\nfocusing on related algorithms. Relevant papers rarely introduce details\r\nor specific techniques in engineering practice. Therefore, we present\r\nsome insights into related technologies based on practical experience\r\nin our real-world AIOps. 13https://www.moogsoft.com. 7.4.1. Programminglanguages\r\nIn AIOps practice, the most commonly used language for developing\r\nAIM tools and systems should be Java which has a complete ecosystem. Some important applications, such as Flink,14are mainly developed\r\nbased on the Java language. Besides, the Scala language is another\r\nwidely used language for development practice these years. Scala has\r\nbeen used in important applications, such as Spark,15a big data process-\r\ning framework, and Kafka,16a distributed publish/subscribe system. Scala is suitable for the development of big data, data mining, NLP,\r\nmachine learning, etc. These two languages are widely used because\r\nlarge-scale streaming processing is essential in alert processing. Mixed\r\nprogramming development in Java and Scala would be an excellent\r\nchoice for developers. In addition, in related research fields, the Python language is widely\r\nused to implement various algorithm prototypes quickly as it is easy to\r\nunderstand and learn and has many algorithm libraries. 7.4.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"S/0ZLxUAE/Hpao5cGIyQllE1qlmrhKXVmHsjswZPGcE="},"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468":{"id_":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"909480a6-f481-41cb-9eb5-91d4dc88568d","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"S/0ZLxUAE/Hpao5cGIyQllE1qlmrhKXVmHsjswZPGcE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"i70ux69q/4fCK/WBFYNRdMZe7dCnjybhtjcPq9eDIVE="}},"text":"7.4.2. Open-sourcetools\r\nIn AIOps practice, several open-source tools can be used to achieve\r\nvarious goals. Grafana17is an open-source data visualization tool with\r\nrich dashboards and charts. It can visualize various data and support\r\nmultiple data sources, such as Graphite, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, Mysql,\r\netc. Grafana allows users to configure thresholds and conditions for\r\nreceiving alerts. And alert notifications can be received through Pager-\r\nDuty, Slack, Webhooks, and Gmail. Therefore, Grafana can be used to\r\ndisplay various metrics, alerts, incidents, etc. Some system monitoring tools, such as Prometheus18and Zab-\r\nbix, can be exploited. The main difference between them is that the\r\ndatabase used by Prometheus is the time series database TSDB, and\r\nthe database used by Zabbix is the relational database of MySQL or\r\nPgSQL. Therefore, Prometheus is more suitable for time series data such\r\nas metrics, and Zabbix is more suitable for storing data such as logs. Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful\r\ncomputations over unbounded and bounded data streams. It is very\r\naccurate in data ingestion and can easily recover from failures while\r\nmaintaining the state. Flink can be used with Kafka to transmit metrics,\r\nalerts, and other data efficiently. In our current AIM practices, we use big data components (e.g.,\r\nFlink) to generate, process, and distribute alerts in real time. However,\r\nwe rarely use big data or high-performance computing components\r\nwhen conducting AIOps alert analyses (e.g., alert storm analysis). This\r\nis because the amount of alerts and incidents is relatively small com-\r\npared to various monitoring metrics. However, as the scale of the\r\nservice system continues to expand, the volume of alerts and incidents\r\nmay exceed the current single-machine analysis capability. Therefore,\r\nhigh-performance computing and big data components (e.g., Hadoop19\r\nand Spark) can be widely used in future alert and incident analysis. 8. Conclusion\r\nThis paper has reviewed the research works carried out in intel-\r\nligent AIM in IT services. First of all, for a unified description and\r\nbetter understanding, the paper summarizes an architecture of AIM. Then, a detailed literature review is conducted based on corresponding\r\nprocesses in the architecture.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="},"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7":{"id_":"8df99ad2-98ed-4625-b0b7-d044c3d5abb7","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"uYZSzu9VgMgCb7y4tgdn1rM/q/JKo1wHrmhbaBsg3qg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0d1be45a-e0e3-4496-956b-9704a5f6a468","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf","file_name":"A survey on intelligent management of alerts and incidents in IT services.pdf"},"hash":"qS9mBPEjkWYkiFJggvU21F67rVrpIWbdicqyDeEL7dE="}},"text":"Then, a detailed literature review is conducted based on corresponding\r\nprocesses in the architecture.

The current cybersecurity paradigm suggests that\r\nany organization can have cyberattacks anytime, regardless of the\r\nsecurity principles applied. Therefore, the preparation/readiness\r\nphase  is  vitally  essential  to  respond  to  these  attacks  adequately. We  first  identified  a  report  on  major  cybersecurity  incidents\r\nthat  is  compiled  by  the  Center  for  Strategic  &  International\r\nStudies, from which we examined major cybersecurity incidents,\r\nand   we   then   established   its   credibility,   non-partisan,   global\r\noutreach,  and  attack  coverage  by  cross-referencing  it  with  Data\r\nBreach  Investigation  Report  (DBIR). Given  this  context,  this\r\nstudy  conducts  a  systematic  literature  review  to  understand  the\r\nbody  of  knowledge  that  highlights  administrative  and  technical\r\ncapabilities of organizations to respond to a likely cybersecurity\r\nattack. Study  findings  show  that  about  72  percent  of  surveyed\r\npapers  suggest  that  more  organizations  embrace  administrative\r\ncapabilities,  especially  compared  to  technical  skills. More  orga-\r\nnizations also recognize the importance of having Cybersecurity\r\nIncident  Response  Team  (CSIRT)  abilities  to  enhance  readiness\r\nto combat potential cybersecurity incidents - this is validated by\r\nthe 88.89 percent score identified in this study. We emphasize the\r\nsignificance of organizations’ readiness to conduct cybersecurity\r\nincident  triage  and  or  thorough  investigation  based  on  the  fact\r\nthat  major  incidents  will  always  occur  as  we  validated  in  this\r\nstudy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"luJthF9aJt8+m9ZAgPmVDQEYOLXfYCRiHPKDPE55g2k="},"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3":{"id_":"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PoW5ZlDRx1T2+ugtGsoVwBqvg6P5xbbncXIKmTe7eBo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"826e2ab5-51ae-4be7-b7e2-a0767b872f2f","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"luJthF9aJt8+m9ZAgPmVDQEYOLXfYCRiHPKDPE55g2k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"/Yos5O43UBXmNYOrciM0WFLxl+DvtIwyqjN05//j0Sw="}},"text":"As  a  result,  using  the  National  Institute  of  Standards\r\nand  Technology  (NIST)  framework  as  an  example,  we  suggest\r\nthat  organizations  should  determine  which  stages  of  the  NIST\r\nframework  are  applicable.

The general overview of cybersecurity incidents\r\nfrom 2005 to 2022 shows that many incidents have impacted\r\nvarious organizations in different regions of the world [2], [3],\r\n[4]. The  likelihood  of  a  cybersecurity  incident  occurring  in\r\nany  organization  is  a  fact. Therefore,  any  small,  medium,  or\r\nlarge organization must have the proper cybersecurity incident\r\ndetection and response capabilities to deal with it if or when\r\nit happens [5].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"G8H1k9PJWe6Kg1fcUTu13xHs1Fkd70+9nW0c0orOvu4="},"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50":{"id_":"4450f05c-1c9c-4ffd-9f15-3136882a9a50","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PoW5ZlDRx1T2+ugtGsoVwBqvg6P5xbbncXIKmTe7eBo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1f5c7efb-95bf-4a0c-9f45-2464c64782e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"G8H1k9PJWe6Kg1fcUTu13xHs1Fkd70+9nW0c0orOvu4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"09f60711-269c-487a-bf76-ce40dcfdf3cb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"CMPF+C5zrnTjkrBeD2yyt+J3h5iceBsP2ZIbDlPx/Lk="}},"text":"Cybersecurity incident detection and response\r\ncapabilities often require the combination of human resources,\r\nsecurity  systems,  information  technology  infrastructure,  and\r\nprocesses  to  be  in  place  for  a  practical  readiness  to  respond\r\nto  an  incident  when  it  occurs  [6].

BACKGROUNDLITERATURE\r\nNo  organization,  including  small,  medium,  and  big  busi-\r\nnesses  and  government  institutions,  is  safe  from  today’s  so-\r\nphisticated  cyberattacks,  even  those  with  the  highest  or  most\r\nrobust security controls in place [14]. When these cyberattacks\r\nare successfully launched to cause adverse consequences to a\r\ntargeted entity, it becomes a cybersecurity incident [19]. Given\r\nthat  cybersecurity  incidents  can  be  compared  to  emergencies\r\nthat  may  have  catastrophic  repercussions,  the  longer  they\r\nare  ignored  or  improperly  controlled,  the  more  severe  the\r\nresults  will  be  [20]. These  aforementioned  premises  echo\r\nthe  importance  of  having  a  prepared  incident  management\r\ncapability  in  place. While  having  an  incident  management\r\nprotocol is very important, it is even more significant to ensure\r\nthat it is well tested [21]. A. Administrative Capabilities\r\nIn  this  section,  we  highlight  some  of  the  administrative\r\ncontrols that organizations employ or at least think about when\r\npreparing for or handling a cybersecurity incident. The list here\r\nis not exhaustive but at least summarizes some of our findings\r\nfrom the literature that we surveyed in this study:\r\n1)  Communication:Projecting  a  positive  outlook  and  en-\r\nsuring effective but transparent public communication during\r\nincident  handling  tends  to  calm  not  just  the  stakeholders\r\nbut  may  also  stabilize  the  market  forces  as  well  [22]. This\r\nsuggests the importance of a communication policy that does\r\nnot only provide coverage for external but internal audiences\r\nas  well. Having  a  policy  drafted  and  approved  may  not\r\nbe  enough. Policy  enforcement  is  also  crucial  for  effective\r\ncommunication  during  handling  of  an  incident  [23].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Yv5g/jvBAxMFZfZrSHX2Wigy6DMBjGQGtSvtOdzb8tw="},"9571d44e-e0db-47c6-bcaa-868290629a7d":{"id_":"9571d44e-e0db-47c6-bcaa-868290629a7d","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"S3OSf2cheeYXJ6KuHXYQOuc+GEbkULUpho1aGBq+Kvg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dfe807d1-3c2b-4087-9b78-3867bab26836","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"Yv5g/jvBAxMFZfZrSHX2Wigy6DMBjGQGtSvtOdzb8tw="}},"text":"Given\r\nhow  in  “today’s  cyber  threat  landscape,  a  wide  variety  of\r\nskills  and  coordination  are  needed  to  combat  increasingly\r\ncomplex challenge” [24], leveraging an effective internal and\r\nexternal communication during the handling of a cybersecurity\r\nincident  may  be  valuable  towards  addressing  the  identified\r\ncyber threats. 2)  Information Sharing:Having the necessary information\r\nsharing strategy in place and effectively executing such strat-\r\negy, whether it is prior the occurrence of a major security event\r\nor during an active cybersecurity incident management, is very\r\ncrucial towards ensuring that all parties are kept informed in\r\nthe  prior,  during  and  post  stages  of  any  given  cybersecurity\r\nincident  [20],  [25],  [26],  [24],  [27],  [28].

Beyond  an  organization’s  inter-\r\nnal  communication,  it  is  also  very  important  to  highlight\r\nhow  information  sharing  can  enhance  cybersecurity  incident\r\nresponse  on  a  global  scale  by  ensuring  the  reduction  of\r\ndisparity of cybersecurity information that is available among\r\ncountries  and  organizations  [27]. Therefore,  national  govern-\r\nments,  industries,  businesses,  and  organizations,  as  well  as\r\nindividual end users of digital devices, share responsibility for\r\ncybersecurity information sharing  [25]. It suffices  to say that\r\nnation states often coordinate shared cyber defense obligations\r\nin order to build capacities to achieve cyber resilience, lower\r\ncybercrime, and secure crucial national infrastructure [25]. 3)  Training:An organization’s “information assets leak out\r\ndue to employees’ careless behavior, for instance, downloading\r\nemails  sent  by  an  unidentified  sender,  checking  linked-pages\r\nincautiously  or  setting  passwords  by  their  own  birthdays”\r\n[29], hence it is very important that the necessary investments\r\nare  made,  with  the  right  programs  designed  to  ensure  the\r\nimplementation of information security training and education\r\nfor  employees  [29]. Also,  given  that  the  global  information\r\ntechnology  skills  shortages  have  surpassed  four  million,  one\r\nof  the  identified  remedies  is  for  organizations  to  take  a  look\r\ninward and strengthen the cross-training of existing informa-\r\ntion  technology  professionals  where  possible  [30]. Incorpo-\r\nrating  information  security  into  some  of  these  cross-training\r\nprograms may also alleviate some of the challenges posed by\r\na lack of cybersecurity education.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MsyiVfLNbVPbs1Ij36XbUMr7PByzmOO/VJNejXji5x8="},"4a3a9a7b-d1f3-488c-8edd-7574c57ec531":{"id_":"4a3a9a7b-d1f3-488c-8edd-7574c57ec531","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"WqI4FjqJQP2pJDh6L4fxclTHwoL2C8nvIG8pURLFA9E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"961dc933-38fd-4ed5-bf84-9abdfbe7f619","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"MsyiVfLNbVPbs1Ij36XbUMr7PByzmOO/VJNejXji5x8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c85d558d-5eff-4609-bb39-210b25f31002","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"RHg63H7pVHtv3upQL194L91gR9GccOZFMoyKnebyBBM="}},"text":"A routine tabletop exercise\r\nis one of the best ways to get ready for handling a significant\r\ncybersecurity event since it raises the knowledge, comprehen-\r\nsion,  and  readiness  of  cybersecurity  incident  response  teams\r\n[21]. 4)  Policies,  Processes,  Procedure  and  Standard  Frame-\r\nworks  (PPP  &  SF):Having  an  enterprise  incident  response\r\npolicy,  well  documented  processes,  clear  procedure,  defined\r\nstandards  and  other  relevant  artifacts  in  place  as  part  of\r\nthe  effort  to  ensure  readiness  for  a  potential  cybersecurity\r\nincident  is  fundamentally  a  necessary  foundation  for  an  ef-\r\nfective  incident  management  and  if  well  enforced,  could  not\r\nonly  ensure  adequate  response  during  incident  handling  but\r\nmay  also  prevent  a  disastrous  fiasco  [31],  [32],  [33].

VI. CONCLUSION\r\nApart from looking at the Significant Incident Report pub-\r\nlished by the Center for Strategic & International Studies [2],\r\nwe also extensively cross-reference the Data Breach Incident\r\nReports [15], [16], [17], [18] in order to validate some of the\r\nnotable security events, from which we drew the introduction\r\nof this paper. As we write this conclusion, one surprise in our\r\nreviewed literature was the emphasis placed on automation as\r\none of the technical capabilities considered in this study. This\r\nfactor scored the lowest mark, accepting a ‘Yes’ of 39 percent\r\namong the literature reviewed. This result is ironic considering\r\nthe huge budget most organizations allocate for automation (as\r\nwell as other technical capabilities) of security infrastructures\r\non yearly basis [67], [68], [69], [70]. It might be necessary at\r\nthis stage to ask why organizations allocate significant budgets\r\nfor  technical  capabilities  that  have  been  proved  in  this  paper\r\nto  be  less  potent  than  administrative  factors  when  building\r\neffective cybersecurity defense systems. Human factors play crucial role in formation of an adequate\r\nrisk management [71], [72]. Most of the concerns associated\r\nwith  human  factors  are  usually  addressed  through  adequate\r\ngovernance that relies heavily on effective policies, processes,\r\nand procedures [73], [74], [75]. This result further emphasizes\r\nvarious works that have proved human factor as a major flaw\r\nor  weak  link  that  must  be  continuously  emphasized  to  build\r\na resilient system. Hence the supporting results of 77 percent\r\nresult for training as one of the key capabilities. Also looking at the data analyzed in this paper, combining\r\nthis  with  our  decades  of  experience  in  information  security,\r\nrisk  management,  and  governance,  we  also  opined  that  the\r\nresults  are  complementary.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PNofu/Y6RhjrkvLcTySKfjDNSL4xJXj6qjEr6OeeOzo="},"753fc20d-dc7a-4c1b-a59b-747b629c6cfc":{"id_":"753fc20d-dc7a-4c1b-a59b-747b629c6cfc","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"iADJakOcJB9MaOnudxVckN1iuBCuTmmim4wLkIQ6dXE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"49bd6e01-9128-4f6e-ad56-0d9aad9295de","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"PNofu/Y6RhjrkvLcTySKfjDNSL4xJXj6qjEr6OeeOzo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d9e5f3e1-2790-4da0-bb46-d0c93c943679","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"3S/EdPLFTq9fcxN/2JTvv1VjxIdZ0+eyHVtdCPtZ/7g="}},"text":"One  of  the  major  game  changers\r\nin  the  security  space  in  the  last  two  decades  is  the  emer-\r\ngence  of  security  automation  systems  that  enable  security\r\nprofessionals to simultaneously scan logs of security incidents\r\nacross infrastructures [76], [77]. These measures are humanly\r\nimpossible  to  achieve,  and  they  underpin  the  importance  of\r\nsecurity architecture. We expect technical tools of this nature to continue to play\r\nsignificant  roles  amid  the  advent  of  more  sophisticated  tech-\r\nnology  such  as  Augmented  Reality,  Virtual  Reality,  Internet\r\nof  Things,  Blockchain,  etc. However,  this  paper  emphasizes\r\nthe need for emerging technical capabilities to be adequately\r\nsupported  with  sufficient  administrative  tools.

However, the\r\nlogical steps in filtering the literature have enabled us to come\r\nto  a  reasonable  conclusion  regarding  key  capabilities  orga-\r\nnizations  must  possess  to  respond  to  and  treat  cybersecurity\r\nincidents effectively.

Potential Size bias\r\nIt  is  pertinent  to  state  that  while  primary  publications\r\nreviewed for purpose of this study provided empirical content\r\non   security   incidents   management,   there   is   no   consistent\r\nevidence that suggested or provided hints on specific sizes of\r\norganizations  considered  under  their  research  works. While\r\non  one  hand  among  OECD  countries,  Small  and  medium-\r\nsized entities account for 95 percent of businesses - controlling\r\na  significant  portion  of  economic  activities  [81],  [82]  and\r\nthey also constitute vast majority of businesses in the United\r\nStates  of  America  as  well  [83];  on  the  other  hand,  mostly\r\nit  is  big-size  organizations  that  adopt  significant  technical\r\ncapabilities  such  as  automation  or  CSIRT  or  SOC  as  part\r\nof  their  security  management  system  due  to  the  huge  budget\r\nrequired,  besides  small-size  firms  that  leverage  security-as-a-\r\nservice to achieve similar fit. Considering the huge population\r\nof  small  and  medium-sized  firms,  it  is  possible  then  that\r\nempirical inputs from most papers we surveyed could be size-\r\nbiased and invariably our output could have favored less costly\r\ncapabilities such as administrative measures (such as policies,\r\nframeworks, training etc). Therefore, we assert the possibility\r\nthat the low score achieved by capabilities such as automation\r\nand SOC could result from this size bias. VIII. FURTHERSTUDY\r\nIn response to the size bias mentioned under the limitations\r\nsection,  we  also  recommend  further  research  to  investigate\r\npossible roles sizes of organizations could play in determining\r\nthe  appropriate  capabilities  necessary  for  building  resilient\r\ncybersecurity  incident  response  systems. While  it  appears  to\r\nbe common knowledge that budget plays a crucial role in an\r\norganization’s choice of capability, cybersecurity systems can\r\nbe optimized within a given context of the organization’s size.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KGFbl4C6e9lho2PwCwsAvi/cW4l2yttigc1KhXC60Bg="},"ee2d0f1e-491f-4d16-8d25-4ff060becb29":{"id_":"ee2d0f1e-491f-4d16-8d25-4ff060becb29","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"mPUs998wjchUSagNwgRXbi2uwIixOzZ5cLPuN7dYwg8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70b04fc7-1b78-4b75-b734-ab3e014a337f","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf","file_name":"An Assessment of Capabilities Required for Effective Cybersecurity Incident Management - A Systematic Literature Review.pdf"},"hash":"KGFbl4C6e9lho2PwCwsAvi/cW4l2yttigc1KhXC60Bg="}},"text":"The  work  for  further  research  would  therefore  need  to  focus\r\non  optimizing  appropriate  capabilities  for  a  given  financial\r\ncapacity of the firm to eliminate size bias from such a study.

When such cyber attacks occur,\r\ne.g. a ransomware outbreak, it is desirable to quickly respond by\r\ncontaining the threat or limit its consequences. Technologies that\r\nsupport this process have been widely used for decades, including\r\nantivirus software and deep-packet inspection firewalls. A large\r\nnumber of researches on cyber security have been initiated to auto-\r\nmate the incident handling process further, often motivated by the\r\nneed to respond to more advanced cyber attacks or the increasing\r\ncyber risks at stake. This paper reviews the research on automatic\r\nincident response solutions published since the year 2000, in order\r\nto identify gaps as well as guide further research. The proposed\r\nsolutions are categorized in terms of the input they use (e.g. in-\r\ntrusion signals) and the output they perform (e.g. reconfiguring a\r\nnetwork) using the D3FEND framework. The solutions presented\r\nin 45 papers published in the academic literature are analyzed and\r\ncompared to four commercially available solutions for automatic\r\nresponse. Many of the 45 papers described input and output in\r\nvague terms. The most common inputs were from asset inventories,\r\nplatform monitoring and network traffic analysis. The most com-\r\nmon output was network isolation measures, e.g. to reconfigure\r\nfirewalls. Commercially available solutions focus more on looking\r\nfor identifiers in reputation systems and individual analyzing files.

Tools that offer support and\r\nprovide system administrators and incident handlers with situa-\r\ntional awareness receive a considerable portion of these resources. These tools enable faster and more efficient responses to be exe-\r\ncuted. They also enable automation of incident response processes. This paper focuses on such automated incident response. To automate incident response processes is, for many reasons,\r\nbeneficial and desirable. Automation can reduce the need of expen-\r\nsive and scarce human resources as well as lead to better, quicker\r\nand more reliable responses to threats. Accordingly, incident re-\r\nsponse technologies that automate parts of the incident response\r\nprocess are already present in many organizations. For example,\r\nantivirus software, email filters, and advanced firewalls systems\r\nautomate things previously requiring human resources. Antivirus\r\nsoftware use signatures and heuristics to block suspicious files or\r\nprocesses that are present on endpoints in the network; email filters\r\ntry to recognize phishing emails and drop or block them; advanced\r\nfirewalls may inspect traffic in the application layer and block or\r\ndrop traffic if it is associated with threats.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"az1yk8EJcbw0dv0lnPhgLbsNZWqD/9xi7zeiHuAj1JI="},"6dd2b4f7-ba2c-44f9-bd9a-87987eac82ef":{"id_":"6dd2b4f7-ba2c-44f9-bd9a-87987eac82ef","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"8XLMuCV6rSBv46MOA368wg43/tzdM4/pQ347TiLVJxc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7b5fcb5f-1272-419d-98e0-d85bc19971e3","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"az1yk8EJcbw0dv0lnPhgLbsNZWqD/9xi7zeiHuAj1JI="}},"text":"However, despite their\r\nutility, the incident response technologies used today are unable to\r\nrespond to all threats organizations face. First, some threats may be difficult to identify unless logs from\r\nmultiple machines and network devices are correlated and com-\r\nbined. For instance, an unusual email may need to be correlated with\r\nunusual host events and suspicious network traffic to be classified\r\nas phishing with enough certainty. Centralized log management\r\nsystems, often referred to as security information event manage-\r\nment (SIEM) systems, enable the correlation of different events in a\r\ncomputer network. A considerable body of research is available on\r\nlog analysis and log correlation of relevance to SIEM systems [19]\r\n[15]. For instance, many solutions correlate alerts using models of\r\nthe steps attackers may take [15]. Second, some responses may require coordination of different\r\ndevices and security components in a network. For instance, a\r\nphishing email may warrant both blocking of the sender in the\r\nlocal email server and blocking malicious links in the network fire-\r\nwall. Means of executing pre-prepared “playbooks” that activate\r\ndefenses, addresses this problem. These executions are often real-\r\nized by security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)\r\nsystems. The scholarly literature is not as extensive and deep when\r\nit comes to the construction of playbooks that respond to networks\r\nattacks. However, best practices for incident handling have been\r\nestablished [18][6], and various ways of specifying responses have\r\nbeen proposed [24]. For example, the language OpenC2 defines ac-\r\ntions (e.g. “deny”) and targets (e.g. “domain_name”) that are relevant\r\n[16].

More specifi-\r\ncally, they may be leveraged to correlate multiple weak intrusion\r\nsignals, and deploy an appropriate response that involves multiple\r\ndefenses. Consequently, several large initiatives have been taken\r\nalong this direction, e.g. the European Defence Fund call “Cyber\r\nthreat intelligence and improved cyber operational capabilities”, the\r\nUK initiative for “Autonomous Resilient Cyber Defence” and the\r\nDARPA call for “Cyber Agents for Security Testing and Learning”. This paper aims to summarize solutions on automatic and semi-\r\nautomatic incident response as described in the scholarly literature\r\nsince the year 2000, and to analyse these solutions in relation to the\r\nplaybooks of available incident response products. As illustrated in\r\nFigure 1, a black box perspective is employed, and the internal logic\r\nof the solutions is not addressed as long as it is (semi-) automatic. Instead, the solutions are classified based on what input data they\r\nuse, what responses they choose from, and how these two relate to\r\nactions of available products. More specifically, the paper answers\r\nthe following research questions:\r\n•Which input data (signals, system information, intelligence,\r\netc. ) are used in proposed solutions for automated incident\r\nresponse? •Which actions (reconfigurations, probes, denylists, etc. ) are\r\nused in proposed solutions for automated incident response? •How does the input and output covered in academic papers\r\ncompare with the playbooks of available products? The answers to these questions can help identify gaps in the\r\ncurrent research, e.g. whether research has focused on only some\r\ninputs and outputs, and whether other issues are of relevance in\r\npractice. Assuming that the published research covers relevant in-\r\ncident handling procedures, the answer to the first question should\r\ninform SIEM developers on what data they should include in their\r\nsolutions, while the second question should inform SOAR develop-\r\ners on what actions their solutions should be capable of executing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gz66xvtmrqfsjXzREG0SD+0kli+2g8XBZju5ByJN3Dc="},"ce732b23-4e32-48bc-8060-03b69e31f478":{"id_":"ce732b23-4e32-48bc-8060-03b69e31f478","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"XNxsruB5KvE/zb7LL+MB0jaSYeANMhtcs9PchIM5PE8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d780e612-e1ce-4236-8859-1c6c89284a06","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"gz66xvtmrqfsjXzREG0SD+0kli+2g8XBZju5ByJN3Dc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e44c5392-ffb7-45a7-a680-ce3f8942c0e0","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"ObULekfddsJA9F88vOnH/Ay2ijKLa3WF8xNdKGy7JwI="}},"text":"In addition, while the answers to these two questions scope the\r\nproblem of automated responses through the lens of academic re-\r\nsearch, the answer to the third question ought to indicate the gap\r\nbetween the research and current practice. Ultimately, the answers\r\nto the three research questions can assist in developing better au-\r\ntomatic and semi-automatic incident response solutions that can\r\nhelp organizations deal with cyber attacks. A number of literature reviews have covered topics related to au-\r\ntomated responses. This includes reviewing research on recommen-\r\ndation systems for cybersecurity incident handling and response\r\n[8], machine learning in relation to SOAR systems [13], and the\r\nrelationship between threat intelligence and intrusion responses\r\n[7]. Papers that address the input and output of automatic response\r\nsolutions are also available. In particular, [1] reviewed and catego-\r\nrized commercial intrusion response solutions and assessed which\r\ninput and output (i.e. responses) they used. Both input and output\r\nwere assessed on a high level of abstraction. Input was categorized\r\nas network input, host input, or input from a SIEM system. Re-\r\nsponses were classified as proactive (three types), reactive (four\r\ntypes), and passive (six types). The review in [1] answers the first\r\ntwo research questions of our paper, but is at a higher level of ab-\r\nstraction, and without papers published since 2010. Another more\r\nrecent review is presented in [2]. This review focuses mostly on\r\ndifferent types of input and detection schemas. It provides a list of\r\nintrusion responses that are said to be common, with 18 types of\r\nresponses (e.g. “enable remote logging” and “lock user account”). It\r\nis unclear how it was determined that these are common. A third,\r\neven more recent, review is presented in [3].

As recommended in [14][20] for systematic literature\r\nreviews, the following is covered: how research was identified\r\n(Section 2.1), how inclusion criteria were applied (Section 2.2), how\r\ndata were extracted and mapped (Section 2.3), and how the extracted\r\ndata were synthesized (Section 2.4). Additionally, the scholarly data\r\nwere compared to the functionality of available products (Section\r\n2.5). 2.1  Study identification\r\nInitially, manual searches were conducted to identify papers with\r\nclear relevance to the topic. Keywords such as SOAR and “automatic\r\nincident handling” were used. Upon review of the resulting papers\r\nand papers cited in these papers, the following search string was\r\nidentified as suitable:\r\n( \"intrusion response\"  OR  \"cyber response\"\r\nOR  \"incident response\"  OR  \"incident handling\"","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ObULekfddsJA9F88vOnH/Ay2ijKLa3WF8xNdKGy7JwI="},"d19751c2-9ad3-4bd4-8ac9-108cb7d0d6cc":{"id_":"d19751c2-9ad3-4bd4-8ac9-108cb7d0d6cc","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"JihGKaMnM+kIunizUZ6y9bBTn1rWocTsjMgu8qG4Kns="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"67bbb07c-b830-4f79-a287-aa927d32965e","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"IFnb87n0eTHxuBgGkv86opf7ffex8k5Riyn5LinQ4qI="}},"text":"Automatic incident response solutions: a review of proposed solutions’ input and output                                              ARES 2023, August 29–September 01, 2023, Benevento, Italy\r\nOR \"security orchestration, automation and response\" )\r\nAND ( auto* )  AND ( cyber*  OR  network ).

Two measures for input were used because most papers focused\r\non a limited part of the problem, and these two types of input\r\ncover differ parts of the problem and received different amount\r\nof attention in the papers. Few papers covered input and output\r\nthoroughly, and only seven papers scored more than three on the\r\nscale on each of the three parts. A total score of six (of maximum\r\n27) was set as a threshold for inclusion. This resulted in 45 papers\r\nto be included in the review. Remaining papers, not meeting this\r\ncriterion, were superficial and presented early ideas or focused\r\nsolely on part of the problem (e.g. describing potential responses\r\nwithout describing input). The 45 papers were assessed as being of\r\nreasonable quality, and as a whole constituting a reasonable amount\r\nof papers from which to extract data.

A number of alternatives were consid-\r\nered for these categorizations. For input, categorizations used in\r\nother research (e.g. the ones in [1], [2] and [24]) and well-known\r\ndata schemas (e.g. Splunk’s Common information model and STIX)\r\nwere considered. For output, schemas proposed for SOAR systems\r\nwere considered (e.g. OpenC2 [16] and CACAO [4]). However, none\r\nof these was found to be ideal for classifying input or output. For\r\ninstance, Splunk’s model is too detailed, while OpenC2 lacks com-\r\nmon actions (e.g. the disabling of user accounts). This review found\r\nMITRE’s D3FEND framework [11], a catalog of defensive cyber-\r\nsecurity techniques, to be suitable for classifying the solutions,\r\nand used version 0.12.0-BETA-2 of D3FEND.

To\r\nillustrate this, Figure 2 outlines the sub-techniques of Network\r\nIsolation. The extraction was performed by reading the included papers\r\nand classifying any mentioned input and output using D3FEND. In\r\nmany cases, this was trivial. For instance, outputs that block exter-\r\nnal hosts using firewalls were mapped toIsolate-Network Isolation-\r\nNetwork Traffic Filtering-Inbound Traffic Filtering(tactic – technique\r\n– sub-technique – sub-sub-technique). In other cases, some interpre-\r\ntation was needed. For example, when the solution in [12] responds\r\nto brute force guessing on SSH, this was classified asDetect-Network\r\nTraffic Analysis-Administrative Network Activity Analysisbased on\r\nthe context given in the paper. Another example is when the solu-\r\ntion responded to unspecified output from Snort, as in [10], where\r\nthe detection was classified only on the highest technique-level\r\n(Detect-Network Traffic Analysis) because of the lack of detail. A\r\nnote was made when the classification required some interpretation. A note was also made when the input or output of the solution fell\r\noutside the scope of D3FEND. For example, D3FEND does not have\r\na response switching over to redundant service, which is discussed\r\nin [22]. For a full list of the extracted D3FEND techniques from\r\neach paper, see Appendix. 2.4  Synthesis\r\nThe extraction form based on the D3FEND techniques allowed\r\nfor a straightforward analysis of the papers. The proportion of\r\npapers using the different techniques for inputs and outputs were\r\ncalculated to answer the first two research questions. Because of\r\nthe high abstraction level in the papers, each paper was associated\r\nwith at most one use of a particular technique, and the highest level\r\nof abstraction in D3FEND was used for comparison.

Network Isolation is highly\r\ncommon both in papers and playbooks, but less so in playbooks. A few playbooks were difficult to relate to D3FEND. More specif-\r\nically, playbooks to restart services, restart machines, and reimage\r\nmachines were found in the repositories. Additionally, the commer-\r\ncial playbooks frequently use different types of data enrichment,\r\nwhich is not the case in the papers. Approximately a quarter of\r\nthe playbooks focus on enriching data, e.g. by looking up threat\r\nintelligence and combining data from systems in order to present\r\nthe synthesized result to a human operator. 4  DISCUSSION\r\nThe discussion below discusses the homogeneity and maturity of\r\nthe research (Section 4.1), the relationships between input data and\r\noutput (Section 4.2), as well as the validity and reliability of this\r\nreview (Section 4.3). 4.1  Homogeneity and maturity of the research\r\nAs described above, the solutions described in the literature cover\r\na wide range of inputs and responses, with clear differences be-\r\ntween them. Alternatives to this heterogeneity and variation would\r\nhave been possible. For instance, the research community could\r\nhave collectively focused on a particular problem of dealing with a\r\ncompromised machine, agreed on the type of input and output to\r\nwork with, and researched techniques for these inputs and outputs. Clearly, this is not how the research community has acted. One\r\npossibility is that researchers have tried to defend against differ-\r\nent cyber attacks, due to differing domains or due to evolutions\r\nof attacks and available defenses (inputs and outputs) over time.

It is also difficult to say\r\nmuch about differences between the inputs and outputs over time,\r\nnot least since the publication levels were very low before 2016.

For example, a solution that analyses prop-\r\nerties of emails in order to detect phishing, will be able to block\r\nsuspicious domains easily but be poorly equipped to lock accounts\r\nthat were compromised by the phishing email if no data linking\r\nthe email to accounts is available. On the conceptual level, the pa-\r\npers discuss these links. However, as the lack of proof-of-concept\r\ndemonstrations suggests, many papers provide vague descriptions\r\nand make little effort to make these links clear. For instance, the\r\ninputs needed to determine if a particular action should be taken\r\nare largely missing. Additionally, this review treats the automated\r\ndecision techniques as a black box. In other words, this review disre-\r\ngards the approach a paper’s solution chooses a response based on\r\nan input, as long as the approach is semi-automated or automated. As such, it is out of scope for this review to consider whether there\r\nare particularities depending on the decision model, e.g. if some\r\nlinks between input and output occur depending on the particular\r\ntype of AI algorithm or other (semi-) automated decision making\r\nalgorithm. Future reviews are encouraged to look into the black box,\r\nfor a white box (or gray box) approach. Such research should also\r\nconsider how real-life complex attacks are performed, as chains\r\nof attack techniques, and thereby address a potential drawback of\r\nusing the technique-based D3FEND framework. On the level of D3FEND techniques, it is worth noting that all\r\nsolutions that use Platform Monitoring as input produce Network\r\nIsolation as output, and 78% of the solutions using Network Traffic\r\nAnalysis as input produce Network Isolation as output. One inter-\r\npretation of this is that Network Isolation is the primary kind of\r\ndefensive measure to employ. Another interpretation is that many\r\nNetwork Isolation measures require knowledge about the assets in\r\nthe network, events on machines, and analysis of network traffic.

It should be noted that many of the play-\r\nbooks in commercially available products concern the enrichment\r\nof data by connecting alerts to threat intelligence, asset inventories\r\netc. One interpretation of this is that aggregation and normalization\r\nof data, in different formats and in different sources, is a substantial\r\npart of the problem of producing automated responses. It could\r\nbe that researchers have avoided this input management part of\r\nthe problem because they want to produce something generic and\r\ntool independent. It could also be that this part of the problem has\r\nbeen avoided simply because it is complicated and not as academi-\r\ncally rewarding as describing mathematical reasoning on abstract\r\nproperties such as signal strength, threat levels, and response costs. Conversely, there may be things that practitioners could learn from\r\nthe current state of research. For instance, playbook developers\r\ncould focus more on D3FEND techniques that are common in re-\r\nsearch but rare in practice, e.g. Network Mapping and Platform\r\nMonitoring for input, or Credential Hardening and Decoy Environ-\r\nment for output. Playbook developers could also learn from what\r\ninputs and outputs researchers focus on that are not in D3FEND\r\nnor in current playbooks.

The four interpretations relate to either the study identification,\r\ninclusion criteria, extraction or synthesis and comparison to com-\r\nmercial products. First, the search string used to identify scholarly literature was\r\nintentionally narrowed in order to find a manageable number of\r\nrecords. It is the belief of the authors that the chosen search string\r\nand indexing database accurately captured the literature on auto-\r\nmatic solutions for responding to cyber incidents. However, the\r\nrequirement that papers should explicitly mention something re-\r\nlated to automated responses excludes many solutions that focus\r\nmore on the input than on the output.

How-\r\never, the authors of this review did not identify any such papers\r\nin the preliminary searches while constructing the search string,\r\nand were not aware of any such missing papers from previous\r\nexperience. Second, abstracts and full text records were used to sort out pa-\r\npers describing solutions of the type addressed in this review. The\r\ntwo authors rated papers independently, and an inclusive approach\r\nwas taken. This inclusivity is visible in the extracted D3FEND tech-\r\nniques from each of the papers, where seven included papers did\r\nnot contain anything that could be mapped to D3FEND. Despite\r\nthe inclusive approach, it is still possible that some relevant papers\r\nwere excluded in the screening process. In order to minimize dif-\r\nferences between the authors’ decisions and fine-tune the criteria,\r\nthere were several discussions on the particularities of the decision\r\nmaking process, as well as some randomly chosen overlapping de-\r\ncisions, e.g. with both authors rating the same paper followed by\r\ndiscussion of rating differences. However, there was no complete\r\npilot-review, where all stages of the review process were trialed\r\nin order to align judgements further or fine-tune inclusion and\r\nextraction criteria. Third, the extraction process was associated with a number of\r\njudgement calls. As noted above, the papers were not always clear\r\non what they required as input or produced as output, and they\r\noften produced outputs not compatible with D3FEND.

In many cases, the papers describe a generic concept\r\nand offer more or less concrete examples of how this concept can\r\nbe instantiated. For instance, a list of example responses may be\r\nprovided. In those cases, the examples are used as the scope of the\r\nsolution. When no concrete examples were presented, no mapping\r\nwas made to D3FEND techniques. The authors’ ability to understand\r\nthe solutions described in the papers, the use of concrete examples\r\nas the definitive scope of the solution, and the decision to ignore\r\nvague descriptions, are all threats to validity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EwSU5pi2Vc54c07m4Oq5y6sf8vBuzs4bDi8gnyXAIOI="},"e439bdb0-de44-461e-b5b2-37bfa446e0cc":{"id_":"e439bdb0-de44-461e-b5b2-37bfa446e0cc","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"rqtECjMHArXOdcPqoPwyMVdBFn/122mH4Dtjt21nsPo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7042e2f4-990a-4c3e-b68b-83ec39380e9e","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"EwSU5pi2Vc54c07m4Oq5y6sf8vBuzs4bDi8gnyXAIOI="}},"text":"However, the decision\r\nto focus on the concrete, but ignore vague descriptions, is justified\r\nby the assessment that vagueness will anyway be a poor guide for\r\nidentifying research gaps.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5kz9bwU8mlC0FWwBs8GjdTRM2y1XVD3r9vstHkEDELQ="},"2cd1087e-e235-4f80-b7ce-c877e8cead4e":{"id_":"2cd1087e-e235-4f80-b7ce-c877e8cead4e","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"ewVnQe4XGZhAkdepFDB0URUxE9iXSBFX9Hp3VwA8Feg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1eb70e7e-e264-4fab-a5ed-89484da29c35","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf","file_name":"Automatic incident response solutions - a review of proposed solutions’ input and output.pdf"},"hash":"Vh4lSlJ2Mvh00kiWpXNoFa8AzWzfKg+LAymN0UStDAw="}},"text":"ARES 2023, August 29–September 01, 2023, Benevento, Italy                                                                                                                               Henrik Karlzen and Teodor Sommestad\r\nFourth, the synthesis and comparison to commercial products\r\ncould  have  been  done  in  other  ways. Alternatives  to  D3FEND\r\nwere considered. In retrospect, it is clear that many of the vaguely\r\ndescribed solutions were a poor fit with the abstraction level of\r\nD3FEND. A model with input as defined by [1] (network input,\r\nhost input, or input from a SIEM system) would have suited many\r\nof the academic papers better. On the other hand, a model on the\r\nlevel of abstraction of Splunk’s Common information model is\r\nwhat an operational solution would have to work on and would be\r\nmore informative to a practitioner, and could have been mapped\r\nto the commercial playbooks. D3FEND was chosen because it is a\r\ncompromise between these two extremes. 5  CONCLUSIONS\r\nThis paper identified 45 papers describing a technical solution that\r\nautomatically responds to cyber attacks, and analyzed the papers’\r\ninput and output using the D3FEND framework. The input to these\r\nsolutions were a mix of system information and detection alerts. The system information available in an Asset Inventory (31%) and\r\ndetails about Network Mappings (16%) were commonly used. The\r\nmore common detection inputs were Platform Monitoring (11%)\r\nand Network Traffic Analysis (22%). Among responses, Network\r\nIsolation (67%), Process Eviction (33%), and Platform Hardening\r\n(18%) were the most common. In addition, many solutions proposed\r\nmeasures not covered by D3FEND, e.g. to shut down machines\r\n(24%). Commercially available solutions appear to be more focused\r\non Identifier Analysis (e.g. reputation of domains) and File Analysis\r\n(e.g. scan email attachments). Commercial repositories also contain\r\nmany playbooks enriching data by looking up things in different\r\ndatabases. REFERENCES\r\n[1]Anuar, N.B.et al.2010.

Thus, it is essential that\r\ncyber forensic investigators are supported to operate more efficiently, in terms of resources and evidence\r\nrecovery, and cope with a wide range of cyber incidents. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 49 works that aim to support cyber forensic in-\r\nvestigations of modern multi-stage cyber incidents and highlights the need for decision support systems\r\non thefield. The works reviewed are compared using 11 criteria, such as their evaluation method, how they\r\noptimise the forensic process, or what stage of investigation they study. We also classify the surveyed\r\npapers using 8 categories that represent the overall aim of the proposed cyber investigation method or\r\ntool. We identify and discuss open issues, arising from this extensive survey, such as the need for realistic\r\nevaluation, as well as realistic and representative modelling to increase applicability and performance. Finally, we provide directions for future research on improving the state-of-the-art of cyber forensics. ©2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These characteristics have made cyber forensic investigations\r\nmore complex, knowledge-demanding and time consuming. In-\r\nvestigators need to spend a significant amount of time to keep their\r\nknowledge and training up-to-date to be able to cope with the\r\nevolution of the current threat landscape. Consequently, the need\r\nhas arisen for decision support methods that will allow in-\r\nvestigators to increase their efficiency (Harichandran et al., 2016)\r\nand complete the analysis of sophisticated cyber incidents,\r\ninvolving a variety of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs),\r\nefficiently and in a timely manner.

We include approaches, both\r\ntechnical and non-technical, that can improve the efficiency of the\r\ninvestigation  of  sophisticated  cyber  security  breaches.

Advanced persistent threats\r\nAlthough originally the term APT was used to refer only to so-\r\nphisticated threat groups that were sponsored by a third-party\r\nentity, currently it has a broader meaning (Ahmad et al., 2019). Specifically, it represents strategic Attackers who are: (i) highly\r\nmotivated and determined to achieve their goals, (ii) stealthy to\r\navoid detection, (iii) deploy a variety of sophisticated TTPs, and (iv)\r\nperform long term or reiterated attack campaigns (Martin, 2014). APT campaigns consist of multiple stages that range from the\r\nreconnaissance and planning of the attack to the achievement of\r\nthe Attackers’final goals. There have been many similar life-cycle\r\nmodels proposed that represent these stages, such as the Unified\r\nKill Chain (Pols and van den Berg, 2017). The termTactics, Tech-\r\nniques, and Procedures(TTPs) is used to describe the behaviour,\r\naims and objectives of such adversaries, as well as the techniques\r\nthey deploy to achieve them (Johnson et al., 2016).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"f6mlqb5yehEupJUmFac/UW/QgYkAxL4zNd3FXQbjtJg="},"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57":{"id_":"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"2tuPAO911PqJRFHSiPd8+mIAro6E4sqwAbBqWZm1bpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"935ddadf-e15f-437e-bf91-b6d88684ce79","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"f6mlqb5yehEupJUmFac/UW/QgYkAxL4zNd3FXQbjtJg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"YeKSYS0inKzgQbEFpGSl0CFPHK4awq/gZBb1chBWY4Q="}},"text":"Currently, the\r\nmost well-known and used knowledge base of TTPs is the MITRE\r\nATT&CK1 framework, which is constructed using real-world ob-\r\nservations through the collection and processing of past incident\r\nreports. 2.2. Cyber forensics\r\nDigital forensics(DF) is the science of collecting, analysing and\r\nreporting evidence from data found on electronic media (Casey,\r\n2009). It combines computer science and investigative proced-\r\nures to investigate (Vacca, 2012) either: (i) criminal activity that\r\ninvolves but does not directly targets computer systems or any\r\nelectronic device, or (ii) malicious activity that directly targets or\r\ninvolves computer systems and networks. The sub-field of DF that\r\nis focused on the latter, and thus overlaps with thefield of cyber\r\nsecurity, is calledcyber forensics. There are many similar or identical investigative process models\r\nfor cyber forensics, but a typical one consists of the following\r\nstages: collection, examination, correlation, and reporting (Kent\r\net al., 2006). Each one of those stages consists of multiple tech-\r\nnical or non-technical tasks. The collection stage includes the\r\nidentification of the media or data that may be related and useful to\r\nthe case, as well as their labelling, recording, acquisition, and\r\nintegrity preservation according to the relevant guidelines. After\r\nthe collection is complete, during the examination stage, the\r\ninvestigator needs to assess and extract relevant information from\r\nthe collected data in an automated or manual way. This is essen-\r\ntially the technical analysis of the data collected and it may include\r\navarietyof tasks, such as examination of the registry, certain events\r\nfrom the collected logs, process analysis or malware extraction\r\nfrom the collected memory dumps or network analysis. It may also\r\ninclude tasks such as decryption, de-obfuscation, reverse engi-\r\nneering or bypassing of certain security features. The correlation stage is where the uncovered information is\r\nconnected and interpreted in an objective and logical way using\r\ndifferent types of inference and reasoning methods.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Q45n91o+aGc96Vl+/Sl7PyJs3DGr8OcN4x+y6a+aoNQ="},"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1":{"id_":"3034dd1c-1a46-4a38-bf27-bb4171a7ced1","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"2tuPAO911PqJRFHSiPd8+mIAro6E4sqwAbBqWZm1bpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f8c4fa15-9476-4e87-9f15-b606613dcb57","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"Q45n91o+aGc96Vl+/Sl7PyJs3DGr8OcN4x+y6a+aoNQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d425231c-810f-45cf-9809-cbf3ad80ae23","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"ENt3VncsCzccTsyKK08nuADer0qfFdgDL59+OFj816I="}},"text":"This may\r\ninclude guidelines and frameworks for good practices or/and tools\r\nand reasoner systems that deploy methods, such as case-based\r\nreasoning (CBR) (Kolodner, 2014), temporal aggregation (Gresty\r\net al., 2016) and forward and backward reasoning (Sharma et al.,\r\n2012).

Instead, we focus on the decision support methods that are aware\r\nof the potential existence of anti-forensic techniques as part of the\r\nincident under investigation.

While\r\nthe authors focus on the high-level investigation process, we focus\r\non the part of the technical analysis and its efficiency. Quick and Choo (2014)study how the large amount of produced\r\ndata affects modern forensic investigations.

Contrary, in this survey\r\nwe review the literature for works that aim to support cyber\r\nforensic investigations, i.e., the investigation of modern multi-stage\r\nincidents potentially performed by strategic Attackers (e.g., APTs),\r\nby increasing their efficiency. This could be achieved either on a\r\ntechnical or more abstract level, in a automated or manual way, by\r\nproposing tools, reasoning frameworks or decision support\r\nsystems. 3. Methodology\r\n3.1. Inclusion criteria\r\nOur aim in this survey is to review works that can be used\r\nduring cyber forensic investigations of modern sophisticated multi-\r\nstage attacks to increase the efficiency and quality of the investi-\r\ngative process. We note that the relevant literature is somewhat\r\nlimited, therefore we included the most known or promising works\r\nin our list that directly or indirectly support any part of such an\r\ninvestigation. Thus the inclusion criteria for this work can be summarised as:\r\nCWorks that directly support and aim to make more efficient\r\nthe technical or non technical phases of a forensic investi-\r\ngation in an automated or manual way. CWorks that although may have not been proposed as cyber\r\ninvestigation support methods, they can be used for this\r\npurpose. An example of this would be a work that has been\r\nproposed as a defence mechanism for event correlation, but\r\nit can obviously be applied to an investigation as well. CWorks that directly or indirectly support the investigation of\r\nmulti-stage attacks. Directly refers to the case where a paper\r\ntakes the multi-stage nature of an incident in consideration\r\nin its modelling and methodology. On the opposite hand,\r\nindirectly refers to a work that although it is not created for a\r\nmulti-stage incident, it can be applied to one.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"62kEJHVWTdj0Kj6/E5isaUV27sUYqXQu0JLX7IeBC88="},"26f43581-81f7-4085-a1d4-78eb7b430a95":{"id_":"26f43581-81f7-4085-a1d4-78eb7b430a95","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"AxgCslMf0+fzqWKJWefTR7C+2RAp69CpnEs9jKqqV3E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"55ebad83-08d7-483b-bc69-12fe9da15dc6","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"62kEJHVWTdj0Kj6/E5isaUV27sUYqXQu0JLX7IeBC88="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7505eaae-1739-4000-8f0d-8fd2bc52f84b","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"Qul1X5nN6y1aiN4ErR7u6xpMhjTG48bHHFukkrqQLhw="}},"text":"With regards to our paper inclusion methodology, we initially\r\ncreated afirst pool of papers based on searches on digital libraries,\r\nsuch as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library with\r\nkeywords like“digital forensics optimisation”,“cyber forensics”,\r\n“forensic decision support”,“multi-stage attack forensic analysis”,\r\netc. We also enumerated the proceedings of relevant top confer-\r\nences and journals like ACM Symposium on Computer and Com-\r\nmunications Security, Digital Forensic Research Workshop, IEEE\r\nTransactions on Information Forensics and Security, and Forensic\r\nScience International: Digital Investigation.

They use a set of\r\nrootkits and anti-rootkits for Windows XP to extract characteristics\r\nfor each software used to derive the benefit and cost values of each\r\nplayer's payoff function. The authors use the Nash Equilibrium (NE)\r\nof the game to identify future improvements that could enhance\r\nthe performance of anti-rootkits. The main difference between the two works is the performance\r\nimprovement achieved in (Hasanabadi et al., 2021). To overcome\r\nthe re-simulation problem caused by the constant need of\r\nexpansion of the action space, the authors propose the use of a\r\nmemory-based mechanism. The mechanism takes as input the\r\noriginal strategy space as well as a list of strategies to be added. After solving the NE of the original game, it iterates through the list,\r\nadding one strategy at a time,finding the corresponding NE and\r\nobserving the opponent's empirical frequencies.

Contrary to most of the literature, the Attacker is\r\nnot simulated as a player, but instead the game is rather a coop-\r\neration between two investigators, who are working in the same\r\ncase and can each select one tool to use during the investigation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qMU5ooH6ziYcynhArmxm8Cv1kt8DShzomSwPL/068WY="},"2cf5b93b-ce49-4cad-99bb-e7b7e157a175":{"id_":"2cf5b93b-ce49-4cad-99bb-e7b7e157a175","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"XnHIAeJYMrhSa/6xMyVodGyN3qCk3VY7RqSHTpZpQjI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"960cb3a1-c1cf-418d-809d-02e305baa516","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"qMU5ooH6ziYcynhArmxm8Cv1kt8DShzomSwPL/068WY="}},"text":"As summarised inTable 1, none of three works for tool selection\r\ntake in consideration the multistage nature of modern incidents or\r\nutilise a knowledge base.

Workload Optimisation\r\nYan et al. (2019)model the database auditing problem as a\r\nStackelberg zero-sum game between an auditor and an adversary. The authors assume different type of events that need to be audited\r\nusing a limited budget, i.e., time, while considering the potential\r\npolicy validations by strategic adversaries. The proposed method\r\nwas shown to outperform traditional auditing policies. De Braekt\r\net al. (de Braekt et al., 2016) propose a workflow management\r\nautomation framework that aims to optimise the use of limited\r\nresources of hardware and software during the acquisition and\r\npreparation steps of forensic investigations. The authors propose\r\nthree modules, each one of which consists of a workflow, which\r\nallows the automation of certain tasks during those steps so that\r\nmore time can be spent on the analysis of evidence. The study of the literature suggests (seeTable 2) that the\r\nnumber of works that optimise the resources of investigations is\r\nlimited. This does not align with the current industry needs, where\r\ncompanies are constantly trying to utilise their resources efficiently\r\nto meet service level agreements (SLAs) and decrease the respond\r\ntime. Neither works utilise a knowledge base, which could decrease\r\nthe active time required byt the investigator. Fortunately, both\r\nworks present a complete evaluation using real data. The work in\r\n(Yan et al., 2019) uses real medical access logs and the Statlog\r\n(German Credit Data) dataset, while (de Braekt et al., 2016)is\r\nevaluated against a real human trafficking case. However, in the\r\nformer the cost and benefit parameters were assumed, i.e., not\r\ngenerated or calculated based on real data. Thus, it is not clear how\r\nthe variation of those parameters would affect the performance of\r\nthe proposed policy. 4.3.

Anti-forensics detection\r\nStamm et al.

Byfinding the NA of the pro-\r\nposed game, the authors identify the optimal trade-off strategy for\r\neach player. The adversary aims to balance the trade-off between\r\nthe use of anti-forensic techniques to hide evidence and the evi-\r\ndence generated by these techniques, while the investigator needs\r\nto balance the accuracy with which she detects manipulated\r\nmultimedia and the accuracy of detecting the use of anti-forensics. Both works use a combination of real and generated data (Table 3). 4.4. Efficiency and Decision Support\r\nHorsman et al. (2014)presents CBR-FT, a case reasoning-based\r\nmethod that aims to increase the efficiency of device triage. CBR-\r\nFT produces a list offile system paths with high probability of\r\ncontaining evidence. To do so it calculates a similarity rating of each\r\npath based on a knowledge base of past cases and input variables. Liu et al. in (Liu et al., 2012a) propose the incorporation of attack\r\ngraphs in forensic investigations to guide the decision process of\r\nthe investigator. The authors also introduce to the graph the notion\r\nof anti-forensic steps, which may be taken by the adversary to hide\r\nmalicious evidence, as parallel actions to the main nodes. Later in (Liu et al., 2012b) and (Liu et al., 2013), the authors\r\npresented a more optimised use of attack graphs in investigations,\r\nby proposing an algorithm that maps evidence graphs on attack\r\ngraphs to identify missing evidence that the investigator needs to\r\nsearch for. In this way, a graph is not simply used as a manual guide\r\nfor the investigator, but part of the reasoning process is automated\r\nto offer suggestions, which results in more efficient investigation. Barrere et al. in (Barr\u0001ere et al., 2017) introduced core graphs,\r\nwhich are condensed versions of attack graphs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K6wrlp15WhRRNI52spaJtUencQbfHXUxSUAydEGe3pc="},"b162d914-88ce-4542-9d48-c8307290238e":{"id_":"b162d914-88ce-4542-9d48-c8307290238e","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_6","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"bOxAfChd9xEST29i4mY9zhSh7226Mti5cLeXLYsQlYw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d866db73-578f-4bdc-8826-760c9805a67a","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"K6wrlp15WhRRNI52spaJtUencQbfHXUxSUAydEGe3pc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c2f03cd7-830d-41b0-a247-eefe163d69ca","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"9QETSft9RZPlnSu0BS2WkB5GveSQBWDtqf/LuDXMOMQ="}},"text":"The authors pro-\r\npose an algorithm that transforms the structure of the original\r\nattack graph to allow for a more efficient exploration.

Niu et al. (2017)model an APT attack as a Targeted Complex\r\nAttack Network (TCAN) by combining dynamic attack graphs and\r\nnetwork evolution. Specifically, the targeted network is modelled\r\nas a two-layered stochastic graph, where thefirst layer represents\r\nthe human social interaction and the second layer the network\r\ntopology. Nodes correspond to hosts, while edges represent the\r\nrelationship between nodes. Finally, network theory is utilised to\r\ncreate rules that capture the time domain factor of the attacker. Arshad et al. (2020)propose FIMOSN, a model to semi-automate\r\nthe forensic investigation of online social networks (OSN). FIMOSN\r\nis a formally defined process model that can be applied to the\r\ndifferentstages of the investigation.It consists of twotypesof steps,\r\nautomated, e.g. the formulation of the Information Extraction Zone,\r\nand manual, e.g. Data Examination. Contrary to other similar\r\nmodels FIMOSN includes the ability of hypothesis testing, as well as\r\nthe ability to adapt to the size of the incident and its requirements. Wei  et  al. (2021)propose  an  unsupervised  prediction\r\nframework for proactive forensic investigation of insider threats. The framework combines cascaded autoencoders (CAEs) and joint\r\noptimisation (CPJOS) for the detection of the anomalous activities\r\nthrough user behaviour features extracted via natural language\r\nprocessing.

Attack reconstruction\r\nMilajerdi et al. (2019)propose HOLMES, a system that uses TTPs\r\nfrom MITRE ATT&CK and the typical APT life-cycle to correlate\r\naudit logs. Specifically, it uses tag propagation and predefined\r\npolicies for backward and forward analysis to correlate audit logs to\r\nTTPs and then organise the TTPs in APTstages. In this way, HOLMES\r\ngenerated high-level graphs for the investigator and is able to\r\nreconstruct APTcampaigns in a timely manner with high precision. Hossain et al. present SLEUTH (Hossain et al., 2017), an OS\r\nagnostic system for real-time attack reconstruction from COTS\r\naudit logs. The proposed system constructs a memory efficient\r\ndependence event graph and uses policy-based approach to\r\ncorrelate events that belong to the same attack. The alerts are then\r\npassed to a backward analysis algorithm to identify source of the\r\nattack. During the evaluation SLEUTH reconstructed 70% of the\r\nattacks in real time. Later in (Hossain et al., 2018) the authors propose two methods,\r\nnamely full dependence preservation (FD) and source dependence\r\npreservation (SD), that allow the reduction of the size of depen-\r\ndence graphs, while preserving the accuracy of the results of the\r\nforensic analysis. Specifically, they prove that the proposed\r\nmethods preserve forward and backward reachability and do not\r\naffect the results of backward and forward forensic analysis. The\r\nevaluation showed that FD and SD can achieve an average of 7x and\r\n9.2x reduction correspondingly, while the LCD reduction algorithm\r\nproposed in (Xu et al., 2016) achieved only a 1.8x.

(2020)proposed MORSE, a system that\r\nuses the tag attenuation and tag decay propagation techniques, to\r\nhelp the analyst reconstruct attacks from large amounts of data. Similarly to their previous works, MORSE uses dependence graphs\r\nto identify events of the same attack. Contrary to SLEUTH, MORSE\r\napplies a conservative tag propagation policy to suspicious subjects\r\nand a more lenient to benign subjects, which allows it to produce a\r\nsmaller number of false positives in real time. Ghafir et al. (2018)propose MLAPT, a machine learning based\r\nsystem for reconstruction of multi-stage APT attacks. MLAPT con-\r\nsists of three phases: (i) threat detection, (ii) alert correlation and\r\n(ii) prediction. At thefirst stage a combination of rules and black-\r\nlists are used to detect TTPs used by APTs from network traffic. The\r\nalerts from stage are fed to the second stage for correlation of the\r\ncampaigns based on the APT lifecycle model. In thefinal stage, a\r\nclassifier based prediction module calculates the probabilistic sig-\r\nnificance of each alert with the aim of minimising their potential\r\ndamage. Although MLAPTdoes notoutperformall the past works, it\r\nis able tooffer a true positiverate of 82%, while minimising the false\r\npositive rate to 5.4% and providing decision support to the analysts\r\nthrough its prediction module. Marchetti et al. (2016)propose a framework for the recon-\r\nstruction of the data exfiltration APT stage from large volumes of\r\nnetworkflows. Contrary to previous works, the authors do not only\r\nuse network wide statistics to identify malicious hosts, but focus on\r\nindividual hosts by comparing their behaviour both to past data\r\nand other hosts in the network. To this end, they calculate a score\r\nfrom a set of three features consisting of three suspiciousness sub-\r\nscores. The proposed framework is evaluated using data from a real\r\nnetwork containing 10K hosts injected with realistic exfiltration\r\nattacks and is shown to be able to detect burst and low-and-slow\r\nexfiltration attempts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ft3AgNYA3JZR17Qfj99QbvmdHlVpT6Ox0Lc728DfmXM="},"e5b76fd6-f126-4e09-8548-c834d4059e10":{"id_":"e5b76fd6-f126-4e09-8548-c834d4059e10","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"SItJTGPM+ULqAxLownJEWoKRNXWeOpNuY5x5R7+L2Ck="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"64f5acaa-5863-46ef-bd2c-629e599f7185","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"ft3AgNYA3JZR17Qfj99QbvmdHlVpT6Ox0Lc728DfmXM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9266eab5-e045-4761-ae58-fd6f0d689f2c","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"1RLfNADh+LzqKPuqvZES4yXhyOYg1CTuCnPY4WsPaT8="}},"text":"Wang and Daniels (2005a),(Wang and Daniels, 2005b) presenta\r\nhierarchical reasoning framework for network forensics that cor-\r\nrelates hosts that belong to the same attack using evidence graphs\r\nof IDS alerts.

Finally,Horsman (2021)presents the Device Evaluation and\r\nPrioritisation Scoresheet (DEPS). DEPS is a structure that assist re-\r\nsponders to identify and collect the digital devices on the scene but\r\nalso to assume and record their priority and importance on the\r\ncurrent case. In this way DEPS does not only support the responder\r\nbut also allows the investigator who receives the collected devices\r\nto optimise the workflow based on the provided formal decision\r\nrecord. Similarly,Beebe and Clark (2005)propose a multi-tier hierar-\r\nchical framework for reasoning guidance during forensic in-\r\nvestigations. The framework consists of two tiers. Thefirst tier is a\r\nhigh level abstraction of a six phase investigation process that in-\r\ncludes the following phases: preparation, incident response, data\r\ncollection, data analysis, presentation offindings and incident\r\nclosure. The second tier includes objective based sub-phases for\r\neach phase of tier one. In this way, the proposed framework can be\r\nused as a guide for both high level and technical parts of the\r\ninvestigation, while being technologically neutral and easily\r\nextensible by the user community. Rekhis and Boudriga (2011a)formally model the investigation\r\nprocess and propose the use of an inference system to detect the\r\npresence of anti-forensics. Specifically, the authors model the sys-\r\ntem under investigation, its deployed security controls, potential\r\nattacks and the corresponding evidence using state-based logic. The authors present a small case study to demonstrate the use of\r\nthe proposed system. The authors also propose investigation-based\r\nTemporal Logic of Actions (I-TLA), a formal temporal logic for\r\ntesting of potential multi-stage attack scenarios on a system\r\n(Rekhis and Boudriga, 2011b). I-TLA is a high-level specification\r\nlanguage that allows an investigator to model different sources of\r\nevidence related to a case, define attack scenarios and hypothesis\r\ntest them on the evidence. Turnbull et al. (Turnbull and Randhawa, 2015) combine a multi-\r\nontology representation of low level data and SPARQLer, a forward\r\nchain rule-based reasoning system to allow investigators to derive\r\nhigh level abstractions and triage the data more efficiently.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P/AQtdiVcLu32V9k4Mjnum8VAqE79MDIcPF/gmhW9us="},"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a":{"id_":"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"nW7xJzcbz45vdGu57LhjRjTk1i2eeCn/pnpOWehouxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2b654ee5-03f2-4bac-a5da-9c7f1d2aaf1f","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"P/AQtdiVcLu32V9k4Mjnum8VAqE79MDIcPF/gmhW9us="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"VJEqfNyLaQBJKxpzzfzMZkw9ZzBaNg2c+jpNhByliEc="}},"text":"First,\r\nthe authors use multiple ontologies to represent system and user\r\nevents from different sources. Then SPARQLer is used to correlate\r\nthe events using predefined rules and forward chain logic. Soltani and Seno (2019)propose the use of temporal logic to\r\nallow the investigator to perform hypothesis testing for event\r\nreconstruction purposes. First, the system under investigation is\r\nmodelled as a transition system both on its normal state (before the\r\nincident) and its current state. Then, the investigator is able to\r\nexpress the properties and hypothesis she wishes to evaluate using\r\nmodalm-calculus. Finally, a checking algorithm explores the state of\r\nthe model and checks if the defined properties are present. Furthermore, the authors address the state space explosion prob-\r\nlem, which is a common drawback on such systems. The proposed\r\nframework is demonstrated using a FATfile system. Saad and Traore (2010)present a framework for network fo-\r\nrensics that consists of a method ontology and a reasoning module. The ontology has different classes to represent the network fo-\r\nrensics domain objects and subjects, as well as their relations and it\r\nsupports deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning operations. Unfortunately, as with other ontology-based works, the construc-\r\ntion and maintenance tasks require a lot of time and effort and\r\ncould benefit from automation.Nieto (2020)presented JSON Users\r\nand Devices analysis (JUDAS), as system for the extraction and\r\ncorrelation of heterogeneous forensic data from IoT devices. JUDAS\r\nextracts unique objects, such as users or devices, from casefiles and\r\ncorrelates them with additional internal sources, e.g., network\r\ntraffic, and external sources, i.e., OSINT. The results are then pre-\r\nsented using interactive graphs to the analyst. The proposed tool is\r\nvalidated using data from Amazon's Alexa from the DFRW 2017/18\r\nchallenge. Amato et al. (2019)present an extensible framework that uti-\r\nlises text processing techniques that allows the investigator to\r\nsemantically represent and visualise evidence from different\r\nsources of the same case. Specifically, the authors propose an ar-\r\nchitecture that receives as input any type of multimedia and text\r\nbased evidence and allows the investigator to perform reasoning\r\nbased on predefined rules, as well as query the data and visualise\r\nthem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0JaWAhFL3yVdRILigSXVE/4v/IepPw4ytMI4JXICym0="},"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566":{"id_":"5e85b31a-1ea7-4d18-a3d1-ae135aa8b566","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"nW7xJzcbz45vdGu57LhjRjTk1i2eeCn/pnpOWehouxY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70459c62-5a65-425e-b75b-7ce3ad37006a","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"0JaWAhFL3yVdRILigSXVE/4v/IepPw4ytMI4JXICym0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d1f9df3b-f172-4fd3-afb8-afedc12e93c1","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf","file_name":"Forensics for multi-stage cyber incidents - Survey and future directions.pdf"},"hash":"EpEahlyfe+LuvvZR+mVMDEFxE4Qw9AsBibFAwUkG8w0="}},"text":"In this way, the proposed framework increases the efficiency\r\nof the correlation of evidence and enhances the investigator's\r\nreasoning capabilities.

The proposed framework is demonstrated\r\nusing the HAFNIUM exchange attack. The comparison of the aforementioned works is summarised in\r\nTable 6.

Han et al. (2019)propose a data-driven, case-based reasoning\r\nframework for decision support on attribution of website deface-\r\nment cases. The proposed framework allows investigators to\r\ncompare their defacement case with past cases and identify the\r\nmost similarones.

Specifically, the Attacker is allowed to move in continuous time\r\nusing a probabilistic distribution, while the defender is moving in\r\nfixed intervals that represent working hours.

Open Issue 1:As can be observed inFig. 3a more than 54%\r\n(Demonstration, No Evaluation and Generated Data) of the sur-\r\nveyed papers did not provide an adequate evaluation of the pro-\r\nposed method. Namely an assessment of the effectiveness of the\r\nproposed method, not a simple demonstration of its use, using real\r\nor realistic data and potentially its comparison against a baseline or\r\npast work to allow better understanding of the results. Specifically,\r\n34% simply demonstrated the proposed method, i.e., showcased\r\nhow it can be applied but did not evaluate its effectiveness or\r\nperformance in any way, while 10% provided no evaluation at all. Moreover, 10% used generated data for the evaluation, i.e., unreal-\r\nistic data that are randomlygenerated and not representative of the\r\nproblem. These facts prohibit the rest of the community from\r\ndrawing robust conclusions regarding the significance and contri-\r\nbution of those works. The reliability and evaluation of a work is essential in anyfield\r\nbut is especially critical in forensics given that the outcome of an\r\ninvestigation is presented either to: (i) the decision makers of the\r\ntargeted organisation, or (ii) a court of law, where the investigator\r\nneeds to be able to support theirfindings (Williams, 2012). One of\r\nthe reasons for this lack of evaluation could be the sensitivity of the\r\ndata related to cyber investigations, which may have been part of\r\nongoing criminal investigations, or cannot be shared for privacy\r\nreasons related to individuals involved in the case or organisations\r\nand companies. In many cases, sharing data from incidents can\r\nreveal private information regarding the infrastructure of an\r\norganisation, technologies in use and current defence mechanisms. This can also be observed fromTable 10, where most of the\r\nutilised datasets are not publicly available, which prohibits the\r\ncomparison between the experimental results of the reviewed\r\nworks.

Another unrealistic\r\nassumption is the use of zero-sumgames (46%,Fig. 6)as theydonot\r\nalign with the motivations of players. The assumption that the\r\npayoffs of the players sum to zero, i.e., one player's gain is equiv-\r\nalent to the other player's loss, goes against the most simplistic\r\nmodel of an interaction between a Defenderand an Attacker, where\r\nonly one of the players may collect the benefit but they both suffer\r\ncosts for their actions. Open Issue 3:Only 2 works use TTPs for the modelling (Fig. 7),\r\nwhile 6 use vulnerabilities, which limits the applicability of the\r\nproposed work on a wide range of incidents, as not all of the At-\r\ntacker's actions can be represented as vulnerabilities. This is\r\nbecause many actions do not include the exploitation of a vulner-\r\nability, but also because a vulnerability is not able to capture any\r\nbehavioural or contextual information regarding the Attacker. Adversarial TTPs are more abstract than vulnerabilities or specific\r\nevents and thus they are able to describe the adversarial behaviour,\r\nits motive and execution instead of simplya technicalflaw that may\r\nbe exploited. In this way, TTPs are applicable in a wider range of\r\ninvestigations and do not face the zero-day shortcoming that vul-\r\nnerabilities do.

As the use of anti-forensic or evasion techniques is on\r\nthe rise (Mandiant, 2021), frameworks and systems that support\r\nthe investigation of modern cyber incidents should be aware of\r\nsuch techniques and incorporate their existence to their modelling\r\nand development process. This is because anti-forensic techniques\r\nallow Attackers to conceal, delete or replace part of their traces. Thus, ignoring their existence may lead to wrong conclusions and\r\ninterpretation of the evidence. This could be avoided by including\r\non the proposed models or frameworks an element of uncertainty\r\nor trust level on the side of the Defender regarding the actions of\r\nthe Attacker. Open Issue 6:None of the survey works is implemented in a\r\nway that allows the feedback from the Investigator to be ingested\r\nand utilised for the readjustment of the output. The step-wise\r\ninteraction between the proposed framework or method and the\r\nInvestigator during the analysis, i.e., the production of suggestions\r\nby the framework to the Investigator and the submission of feed-\r\nback by the Investigator to the framework, could allow the cus-\r\ntomisation of the produced output to increase its accuracy. Open Issue 7:Finally, only one of the reviewed works included\r\nthe element of time in their modelling, by using a differential Nash\r\ngame (Yang et al., 2018). However, time is an important factor for\r\nany investigation that can affect the rest of the variables, such as\r\nbenefit and impact, of the investigation. For instance, the longer\r\ncertain adversarial actions (e.g., active exfiltration channel) stay\r\nundisclosed the greater their impact on the infrastructure. Simi-\r\nlarly, many types of evidence, such as IPs, are time sensitive and are\r\nno longer useful after a certain amount of time. Thus, the notion of\r\ntime should be taken in consideration and potential methods that\r\nallow the definition of states and their transition, evolution or\r\ndiscount factors, which have been used in other securityfields,\r\ncould be applied in cyber forensics. 6.

Keywords    Cybersecurity, Regulatory Compliance, Incident Reporting. Abstract      In today’s digital landscape, cyber incidents have become more frequent and sophisticated, posing significant \r\nthreats  to  organizations  and  individuals. To  mitigate  these  risks,  governments  and  regulatory  bodies \r\nworldwide have developed various incident reporting regulations for organizations to follow. However, the \r\neffectiveness of these regulations in handling cyber incidents remains a point of debate. This paper focused \r\non examining current cyber incident reporting regulations and their characteristics, with the primary objective \r\nof identifying the regulatory factors that impact the effectiveness of these regulations. Key aspects under \r\ninvestigation included timing requirements, the clarity in defining cyber incidents, and the provision of \r\nexplicit guidelines regarding the necessity and scope of reporting incidents. Finally, it provides insights into \r\nhow regulatory requirements can be improved to better handle cyber incidents in today’s rapidly evolving \r\nregulatory environment. 1  INTRODUCTION \r\nThe increased reliance on digital technologies and the \r\nrise of ransomware attacks made the start of the 2020s \r\na particularly vulnerable period for cybersecurity. For \r\nexample,  in  March  2021,  the  Health  Service \r\nExecutive  (HSE)  of  Ireland  was  attacked  using a \r\nparticular type of ransomware called “Conti,” which \r\ncaused prolonged interruption of care provision in the \r\nnation’s  healthcare  system  and  severely  affected \r\ncritical services, such as gynecology and maternity \r\nclinics  as  well  as  cancer  and  children’s  care \r\n(Ivanković et al., 2023). Other attacks, including the \r\nJBS Foods ransomware attack, the Kaseya supply-\r\nchain  attack,  and  the  Accellion  data  breach, \r\nhighlighted the persistent and evolving nature of these \r\nthreats  and  demonstrated  the  need  to  adequately \r\nregulate  reporting  mechanisms  (Bunge,  2021; \r\nMerken,  2022;  Whitney,  2021).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CcCqQComEKrzk45tO/yKftMgn1NgJIkQiteSu/wa40I="},"b30a3554-7f9c-4141-94ec-0738d665589b":{"id_":"b30a3554-7f9c-4141-94ec-0738d665589b","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"E7izqVH/yAtvZ03gUim9fAwBLjB6NXAZzk36G3JTEss="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0dc039b5-2cc1-4c25-ad1e-198aaa995f78","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"CcCqQComEKrzk45tO/yKftMgn1NgJIkQiteSu/wa40I="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c5a4dde6-712e-4034-aeb0-ea905342a48a","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"5Wc9YRoUU+R8bXgpzWvwDWzKgBRUahq8vX4lKZD3+n0="}},"text":"In  the  past,  most \r\nreporting  requirements  were  based  primarily  on \r\nprivacy  issues,  in  particular,  the  disclosure  of \r\nPersonal Identifiable Information (PII).

Over \r\nthe years, significant developments have been made \r\nin developing cyber incident reporting regulations, \r\nincluding  establishing  cybersecurity  agencies  and \r\ncreating cyber threat intelligence sharing platforms. For  instance,  in  the  United  States,  the  National \r\nInstitute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  has \r\ndeveloped   a   comprehensive   framework   for \r\nimproving critical infrastructure cybersecurity (Ross \r\net  al.,  2021). The  framework  provides  a  set  of \r\nstandards,  guidelines,  and  best  practices  to  help \r\norganizations better manage and reduce cyber risks. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security \r\n(DHS)  has  established  the  Cybersecurity  and \r\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which serves \r\nas  the  nation’s  lead  agency  for  cybersecurity \r\n(Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, \r\nn.d.). CISA helps to coordinate the response to cyber \r\nincidents and provides guidance to organizations on \r\nhow  to  improve  their  cybersecurity  posture. Thus, \r\nagencies such as NIST and CISA play a critical role \r\nin developing and supporting regulatory efforts.

To further clarify the Order, the \r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a \r\nmemorandum  in  September  2022  specifying  that \r\nagencies must adhere to the NIST Guidance (Boyens \r\net  al.,  2013;  Young,  2022). This  guidance \r\nrecommends  that  organizations  have  an  incident \r\nresponse plan in place and ensure that employees are \r\nadequately trained to respond to cybersecurity threats. Another  regulation  aimed  at  improving  the \r\nnation’s  cybersecurity  posture  by  strengthening \r\nincident  reporting  and  response  capabilities  is  the \r\nCyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure \r\nAct (CIRCIA), which was signed into law in March \r\n2022. CIRCIA  requires  critical  infrastructure \r\norganizations to report any cyber incidents to CISA \r\nwithin  a  specified  timeframe.

In  particular,  most  experts  agree  that  many  cyber \r\nincidents  involve  a  country’s  Critical  National \r\nInfrastructure (CNI) (Gkioulos & Chowdhury, 2021; \r\nMaglaras  et  al.,  2019). For  example,  the  North \r\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical \r\nInfrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) was one of the \r\nfirst  incident  reporting  regulations  specifically \r\ndesigned  to  ensure  the  security  of  critical \r\ninfrastructure  systems  and  protect  sensitive  data \r\n(Awati, 2022). Consequently, critical infrastructure \r\nprotection has emerged in the literature as a pressing \r\nconcern and a critical area to examine as part of the \r\nnew  regulatory  landscape  surrounding  incident \r\nreporting (Slayton & Clark-Ginsberg, 2018). However,  some  scholars  argued  that  these \r\nregulations  present  several  challenges  (Madnick, \r\n2022a; Silverajan & Vistiaho, 2019). For instance, \r\none problem is that most countries’ cybersecurity-\r\nrelated  laws  have  focused  on  privacy  rather  than \r\ncybersecurity,  leaving  companies  without  the \r\nnecessary tools and information to report incidents \r\nand  counter  cyber  threats  (Madnick,  2022b).

On the other hand, Andreasson and \r\nFallen (2018) presented a different perspective on this \r\ntopic,  highlighting  the  importance  of  balancing \r\nsecurity objectives with other regulatory goals, such \r\nas privacy, to achieve cyber resiliency.

Cyber  incidents  such  as  those  described  above \r\nhave   provided   important   lessons   about   the \r\nsignificance of incident reporting in regulations. The \r\nfirst  lesson  learned  is  the  importance  of timing  in \r\nreporting.

In  particular,  the  SEC’s \r\nrequirement to report within four business days only \r\napplies  if  the  attack  is  deemed  “material. ” \r\nDetermining whether an incident is “material” can be \r\ncomplex and time-consuming. Therefore, analyzing a \r\ncyber-attack  can  take  weeks,  and  establishing \r\nmateriality can be subjective. As a result, an incident \r\nthat one company views as not material and, thus, is \r\nnot  reported,  would  not  provide  the  useful \r\ninformation  needed  to  prevent  a  similar  attack  on \r\nanother  company  who  would  view  it  as  very \r\n“material. ” \r\n4.2  Definition of an Incident from a \r\nSecurity and Compliance Point of \r\nView \r\nThe  digital  landscape  has  changed  considerably, \r\nmaking  regulations  often unsuitable for  defining a \r\ncyber incident adequately. As a result, organizations \r\nface  the  challenge  of  determining  which  incidents \r\nqualify  as  cyber  incidents  and  which  do  not. To \r\naddress  this  issue,  new  or  updated  legislation  was \r\ncreated to provide clearer definitions. For example, in \r\n2020, the European Commission made a proposal to \r\nupdate the NIS Directive as part of the new EU \r\nCybersecurity  Strategy. As  a  result,  the  revised \r\nDirective (NISD2) provided a much more nuanced \r\ndefinition of a cyber incident than the one outlined in \r\nthe  previous  version issued  in  2016  (NISD) \r\n(Directive (EU) 2016/1148, 2022). However,  interpreting  the  regulations  remains \r\nchallenging, especially in determining if a cyber issue \r\nhas the potential to become an incident. For example, \r\naccording to one official definition provided by NIST, \r\na  cyber  incident  only  requires  an  action  that \r\n“imminently  jeopardizes”  a  system  or  presents  an \r\n“imminent threat” of violating a law (NIST, 2011).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"00o/KAxjjVmT5NJ2F3e626FwCUm3oM5Vnuq6rsQ+PLE="},"8febd7b8-a1cd-4c93-b01b-44dbcb593a89":{"id_":"8febd7b8-a1cd-4c93-b01b-44dbcb593a89","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"bMBww4PEiGir6a6f779KJXCn50XhzLAC0WSkZ93eK2o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"026faae5-545d-49a6-8813-86e66a1c5cf5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"00o/KAxjjVmT5NJ2F3e626FwCUm3oM5Vnuq6rsQ+PLE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"669f2007-3e20-45e9-9f08-f01fab3792b8","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"3WkG0XJGTndOp1uDIbky8LDfV5+7XNoSah4xYNkk90k="}},"text":"More specifically, a cyber incident is defined as an \r\noccurrence that: \r\n(1)  actually,  or  imminently  jeopardizes,  without \r\nlawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, \r\nor availability of information or an information \r\nsystem; or  \r\n(2)  constitutes  a  violation  or  imminent  threat  of \r\nviolation  of  law,  security  policies,  security \r\nprocedures, or acceptable use policies. This  definition  includes  incidents  that  do  not \r\nnecessarily need to result in an actual security breach \r\nbut could lead to one (Madnick, 2022a). An analogy \r\nto understand this issue is the aviation term “near \r\nmiss” or “close call,” which refers to the loss of safe \r\nseparation between aircraft in flight (Thoroman et al., \r\n2019). This particular circumstance can result in a \r\nmid-air collision in the worst-case scenario. A similar \r\nsituation  can  occur  in  cybersecurity  as  well.

However,  the  impact  of \r\nthese   regulations   requires   significant   changes \r\nthroughout the organization, which are not just limited \r\nto  the  actions  undertaken  by  security  leaders,  such \r\nas CISOs and CIOs. Top management and the Board \r\nmust be fully aware of the scope of these regulations \r\nand  review  the  related  compliance  procedures \r\naccordingly. Additionally, employees must be trained \r\nto  understand  current  policies  and  processes. Particularly  attention  must  also  be  devoted  to \r\nunderstanding  new  concepts  introduced  in  new \r\nregulations, such those concerning “materiality. ” The \r\ndefinition  of  materiality  may  play  a  critical  role  in \r\ndetermining which incidents should be reported; it can \r\nhelp  organizations  determine  the  significance  or \r\nimpact  an  incident  could have  on  their  operations, \r\nreputation,  or  financial  stability. However,  current \r\nregulations  incorporating  this  concept  may  include \r\nvague requirements and guidance. Thus, organizations \r\nstruggle  to  determine  which  incidents  should  be \r\nreported, leading to issues, such as underreporting or \r\noverreporting  of  incidents. As  a  consequence, \r\nunderreporting incidents can result in regulators being \r\nunaware  of  potential  threats,  while  overreporting \r\nincidents  can  lead  to  a  waste  of  resources. It  is, \r\ntherefore, essential for regulators to enhance current \r\nregulatory  initiatives  and  learn  from  the  positive \r\nfeatures  of  regulations,  such  as  Security  Directive \r\nPipeline-2021-02C  and  Critical  Entities  Resilience \r\nDirective  (CERD).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SqqTXhYpMNKsB4NffYvQjXlaFkltQwRQumkHdO3J7iA="},"924d85e4-9f7a-4072-b9bf-ffe639ed768b":{"id_":"924d85e4-9f7a-4072-b9bf-ffe639ed768b","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf_6","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"cExoG6aeXDTufOs8clWwEavuF54XLDb1BxJWV/u911U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8bbb1b4a-7e5e-4e21-bb87-12b23d6ba851","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"SqqTXhYpMNKsB4NffYvQjXlaFkltQwRQumkHdO3J7iA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f068ac3c-7f29-4d48-8e3e-33c761d9e01e","metadata":{"page_number":6,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf","file_name":"Regulating Cyber Incidents - A Review of Recent Reporting Requirements.pdf"},"hash":"ukjgfHdgXeB5C+shMP6BOmk8yOWzqWux8DeH52Dwl5Y="}},"text":"For  example,  by  incorporating \r\nclearer timelines for reporting incidents and expanding \r\nthe definition of reportable incidents, regulators can \r\nensure  that  organizations  are  aware  of  potential \r\nincidents that could adversely affect their business and \r\ncustomers. However, recently, there have been some \r\nnotable improvements in the field of incident reporting. For  instance,  the  Biden-Harris  Administration \r\nunveiled  a  new  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  on \r\nMarch  2,  2023,  which  aims  to  protect  the  United \r\nStates’ critical digital infrastructure (The White House, \r\n2023). This  strategy  was  developed  in  response  to \r\nseveral cyber threats that posed a significant risk to \r\npublic services in recent years. In particular, “Strategic \r\nObjective 1.4” under this strategy focuses on updating \r\nthe  Federal  Incident  Response  Plans  and  Processes, \r\nwhich  also  includes  enhancing  the  CIRCIA. More \r\nspecifically, according to this objective, the Act will \r\nrequire all critical entities to report cyber incidents to \r\nthe  CISA  “within  hours. ”  Thus,  these  timely \r\nnotifications will enable faster incident response at the \r\nFederal  level. The  road  to  overcoming  incident \r\nreporting  challenges  is  still  long. However,  it  is \r\nessential to advise regulators, either directly or through \r\nindustry  associations,  to  help  improve  regulations \r\ncontinually. Thus, organizations and regulators must \r\nwork together to increase the quality and quantity of \r\ncyber-attack  reporting  and  discuss  regulatory  issues \r\nthrough collaboration and feedback.

The breach is a security incident in which personal and sensitive\r\ndata are exposed to unauthorized individuals, with the potential to incur several privacy concerns. As an example, the French newspaper Le Figaro breached approximately 7.4 billion records that\r\nincluded full names, passwords, and e-mail and physical addresses. To reduce the likelihood and\r\nimpact of such breaches, it is fundamental to strengthen the security efforts against this type of\r\nincident and, for that, it is first necessary to identify patterns of its occurrence, primarily related to\r\nthe number of data records leaked, the affected geographical region, and its regulatory aspects. To\r\nadvance the discussion in this regard, we study a dataset comprising 428 worldwide data breaches\r\nbetween 2018 and 2019, providing a visualization of the related statistics, such as the most affected\r\ncountries, the predominant economic sector targeted in different countries, and the median number\r\nof records leaked per incident in different countries, regions, and sectors. We then discuss the data\r\nprotection regulation in effect in each country comprised in the dataset, correlating key elements of\r\nthe legislation with the statistical findings. As a result, we have identified an extensive disclosure\r\nof medical records in India and government data in Brazil in the time range. Based on the analysis\r\nand visualization, we find some interesting insights that researchers seldom focus on before, and it is\r\napparent that the real dangers of data leaks are beyond the ordinary imagination.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wfwAzY5Gq0pE03WeltoFH1HT5dCFj2BNfqAoWSbOEAc="},"5e5f9751-62d5-4c81-aed8-0832f5a2ad14":{"id_":"5e5f9751-62d5-4c81-aed8-0832f5a2ad14","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"O0+DEIb2hF37pSwbcfT7rxqNwQwp/Ao9jRXXCEpeRlg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"157866ea-4158-43fb-9980-cb1da4b77808","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"wfwAzY5Gq0pE03WeltoFH1HT5dCFj2BNfqAoWSbOEAc="}},"text":"Finally, this paper\r\ncontributes to the discussion regarding data protection laws and compliance regarding data breaches,\r\nsupporting, for example, the decision process of data storage location in the cloud.

Introduction\r\nIn an information-rich world, data have become a valuable asset for businesses across\r\nall industries [1]. If effectively collected, analyzed, and utilized, data can enhance decision\r\nmaking, optimize operations, and propel business growth, empowering companies to\r\nunderstand customer behavior, personalize marketing campaigns, and develop innovative\r\nproducts and services [2]. This applies to both private entities and the public administration. While the benefits of data are evident, they also conceive associated implications,\r\nparticularly regarding security and data subject privacy [3].

Depending on the type of data stored,\r\nadditional concerns emerge, such as credit card information leakage promoting financial\r\nfrauds [5] and breach of medical records disclosing sensitive diagnosis [6]. Likewise, for companies and public entities, unintentional data disclosure may imply\r\nreputational damages [7], lawsuits [8], and direct financial losses [9]. Due to these impacts,\r\nthe average cost of a data breach in organizations with high-security skills shortages is USD\r\n5.36 million [10]. Because of these repercussions for both the data subjects and the data owner, busi-\r\nnesses and governments must deploy security controls to safeguard sensitive information\r\nfrom unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse [11]. Implementing robust cybersecurity\r\nmeasures, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, is essential to\r\nprotect both the company’s data and the privacy of its customers [12]. Organizations  took  204  days as  the  mean  time to  identify  a  data compromise in\r\n2023, representing only marginal changes from the numbers of previous years [10], which\r\nemphasizes the need for a more efficient deployment of detection mechanisms. For that, an\r\nimproved comprehension of trends in data breaches is necessary. To advance this discussion,\r\nwe conduct a visualization approach for enhancing the understanding of data leak patterns\r\nworldwide, which advances the planning for security control employment. This work\r\nprovides a comprehensive overview of data breaches and offers valuable insights into\r\npreventing and mitigating these incidents. Additionally, the overview of data protection\r\nlaws associated with the observed statistics contributes to the enrichment of the discussion\r\nregarding the regulatory landscape. This paper’s contributions can help organizations and\r\ngovernments of all sizes and industries to protect their data and their customers. A geographical-oriented discussion and statistics visualization related to data compro-\r\nmises is also relevant as the data on the cloud may be stored abroad, and incident trends\r\nand regulatory analysis may be suitable for protecting the data appropriately [13]. As the\r\nfoundation of this study, we use a dataset of data breaches with at least 30,000 affected\r\nrecords  that occurred globally between 2018 and 2019 [14].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"//goDRT8eNuX+aF08PDgPggAs3H9LsanbGfdeiIA7PU="},"e7728401-6345-40f3-a077-ab0385b0fe83":{"id_":"e7728401-6345-40f3-a077-ab0385b0fe83","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"8ZiCAjt4bo2oiqUbFqMGN7FOR7Dmtc9karVtJHswwPI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f7a12fc6-26a1-447c-b6fc-4c7830316056","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"//goDRT8eNuX+aF08PDgPggAs3H9LsanbGfdeiIA7PU="}},"text":"The remainder of this work is structured as follows:  Section 2 reviews the related\r\nliterature, Section 3 provides a visualization of the statistics regarding the data breaches\r\npresent in the studied dataset, Section 4 discusses some incidents specifically, Section 5\r\nreviews the applicable data protection laws of the affected countries in the dataset, and\r\nSection 6 presents some of the threats to the validity of the study. Section 7 concludes\r\nthe paper. 2. Literature Review\r\nData protection frameworks may not be adequately structured to regulate the collec-\r\ntion and processing of user data using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For instance, the\r\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may not properly protect the data\r\nprocessed by this technology [15]. This raises security concerns and users’ privacy issues,\r\nespecially considering the low-security awareness of IoT consumers and the possibility of\r\ndata breaches [16]. Considering the applicability of IoT devices in the healthcare environment [17], medi-\r\ncal records may be leaked, exposing sensitive data such as medical treatments, vaccines\r\ntaken, diagnoses, and exam results. Due to its sensitivity, several authors have studied\r\nbreaches related to these types of data and their implications in the regulatory realm [18,19]. While continuing the analysis of medical privacy violation, statistical visualization\r\nassists in uncovering key insights and trends within these incidents. As an example, it has\r\nbeen observed that healthcare organizations are mainly breached due to hacking activities,\r\nindicating a weakness in the technological countermeasures deployed by companies in this\r\nsector [20]. Alfawzan et al.[21]studied 23 mobile women’s health apps, and evaluated\r\nthem on their privacy and data collection policies, remarking that some of them collect the\r\nuser’s data without consent and that most of them share the data with third parties.

The authors have also remarked that, in the time frame of\r\nthe studied dataset, comprehended between 2005 and 2016, more than half of the data\r\ncompromises affected the healthcare sector, and negligent data exposure happens twice\r\nmore frequently than malicious ones. In addition to incident pattern identification, threat intelligence methods also aim to\r\ngather information on the attacker intentions, trends, and procedures, enabling the organi-\r\nzation to better protect its informational assets [24]. However, the effective implementation\r\nof threat intelligence faces some challenges, such as the complexity of the threat landscape,\r\nthe big data scenario, and the lack of transparency and visibility [25]. As an example of\r\na threat intelligence framework for data breaches, Noor et al.[26]proposed a machine\r\nlearning model that achieved a 92% detection rate, with an average detection time of 0.15 s. Data  disclosure  may  negatively  affect  the  stock  prices  of  the  breached  company,\r\nand its recovery may depend on factors such as its age,  size,  profitability,  and brand\r\nfamiliarity [27]. A tendency of short sellers to exploit prior knowledge of a data breach\r\noccurrence [28] has also been observed. To reduce the frequency and repercussions of a\r\ndata leak, countermeasures must be effectively adopted and tested [11]. Machine learning\r\nalgorithms are also applicable to prevent and deter these incidents [29]. It is also relevant to study the changes in the behavior of data subjects after a breach. It is observed that, after an incident of this type, users of a website seeking extramarital\r\naffairs tend to decrease the messaging frequency and delete their posted pictures, returning\r\nto normal usage after three weeks [30].

Companies also tend to report a data breach in complicated language\r\nand in lengthy paragraphs [32], which may compromise its readability and understanding\r\nby the affected users. On the data protection regulation and beach incidents, Alazab et al.[33]studied the\r\nAustralia’s Notifiable Data Breach scheme, referring to a greater responsibility given to\r\ndata subjects while data protection entities are treated with more leeway.

Authors have also studied privacy and data protection laws within the jurisdiction\r\nof some of the countries mentioned in this work, such as in China [35], in India [36], in\r\nBrazil [37], in Singapore [38], in Israel [39], and in the European Union [40]. 3. Dataset Visualization\r\nThe dataset studied in this paper is provided by  Neto et al.[14]. For the recognition of\r\npatterns of occurrences of data breaches, we present visualizations of the dataset according\r\nto their geographical and economic sector incidence and to their sizes. 3.1. Data Collection Methodology and Considerations\r\nAccording to Neto et al.[14], the database creation was based on publicly available\r\nsources from government entities, security research groups, research entities, and media\r\nreports in several languages. An incident was only included in the dataset if confirmed by\r\nmultiple sources or if a source provided evidence of its occurrence. The incidents were also\r\nfiltered to include exclusively data breaches reported between January 2018 and December\r\n2019 that exposed at least 30,000 records. This resulted in a dataset comprising 428 incidents,","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qlFA0grVRBX5cvmzKQFom3ePqm9Vm5qs7u6wsmOcJKw="},"6b8b85cd-cd76-46c2-a563-867d910ea72c":{"id_":"6b8b85cd-cd76-46c2-a563-867d910ea72c","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"/rRmoVhwlczriWCTsKbV/m4tEfJWqeTljd5W3hbBeGA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0946ab41-e969-44b7-9457-0647c600a272","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"zcJ3aw72/vvQt9foNE2bLKQ94opIXJFUZi5wSFeS7gE="}},"text":"Data2023,9, 274 of 24\r\nwhich can be accessed through a web page1.

This computing\r\nmodel enables data to be stored across the borders of the customer country,  and new\r\nchallenges emerge, especially related to security and regulation [44].

One of such controls is an effective cryptographic mechanism. The biggest incident\r\nreported in India affected Aadhaar and exposed one billion records in January 2018. This\r\nbreach is categorized as in the medical sector by Neto et al.[14], possibly due to its relation\r\nto health services [56], including vaccines [57], despite Aadhaar being a biometric database\r\nalso used for demographic, financial, and welfare policy entitlement data [58]. According\r\nto the reference linked to the incident in the dataset, Aadhaar actually suffered multiple\r\nbreaches between 2017 and 2018, which may be due to known vulnerabilities, such as\r\ncryptographic issues observed in the system [59]. As countermeasures, besides a stronger\r\nencryption scheme, Tyagi et al.[60]also suggest the adoption of security testing, the creation\r\nof a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), and a more effective integration with\r\nthe private sector and their standards. Following the implementation of these controls, the\r\nauthors also recommend initiating open security challenges. There were two reported incidents in Japan, both within the business sector. The\r\nlargest  involved  Toyota,  which  experienced  a  breach  affecting  over  3  million  records\r\nin  2019.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9dz3hUgnVAnlK8qdw6MLHf90zqlls8Hi0PhexDVZ49k="},"dc9b0c57-abb3-411b-b2ab-1639b9e6cc33":{"id_":"dc9b0c57-abb3-411b-b2ab-1639b9e6cc33","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"cZLTHqImdgCO2ljG8TkmLl/bSiBSajk/uEhH4JedjMA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"821eab72-a7a5-4725-a153-5f446246cc1e","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"9dz3hUgnVAnlK8qdw6MLHf90zqlls8Hi0PhexDVZ49k="}},"text":"This  case  draws  attention  to  the  expanding  field  of  self-driving  cars,  which\r\nrequire big data for effectiveness and penalization [61].

Accord-\r\ning to the official portal of the Brazilian Ministry of Health2, the incident occurred due to\r\nthe leakage of an access credential to the system. This compromised personal data such as\r\nthe individual taxpayer registry number, name, mother’s name, gender, race, date of birth,\r\nblood type, nationality, and date of death. The sensitiveness of this data, along with the the\r\nattack vector on this case, reinforces the importance of a secure credential storage with the\r\nuse of strong hashing and salting algorithms [63], multi-factor authentication [64], and a\r\npassword breach alerting system [65]. Additionally, to enhance identity protection, the use of common passwords should\r\nbe avoided. The Zynga breach in 2019, in the United States, exposed 218 million records,\r\nand revealed that the most used passwords included strings such aspassword,12345,\r\nchangeme, andqwerty[66]. The enforcement of a password policy, requiring more secure\r\npasswords, should be employed. Additionally, security awareness programs may also\r\nimprove the security on both the user’s and the employee’s end, reducing the use of weak\r\npasswords and the likelihood of successful phishing campaigns [67]. Adversarial Tactics and Techniques Framework\r\nFor the application of more tailored security controls and for more efficiently mit-\r\nigating breach risks, a threat intelligence program may be necessary [68]. To assist in\r\nthis task, the MITRE ATT&CK, a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques,\r\nis a valid framework for threat modeling and the efficient employment of data breach\r\ncountermeasures considering the observed malicious behavior [69]. This structure organizes the security knowledge into hierarchies. It presents several\r\nadversarial techniques categorized into 14 tactics, which are namely reconnaissance, re-\r\nsource development, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense\r\nevasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control,\r\nexfiltration, and impact. Each of these tactics comprise different techniques that may be\r\nused by attackers to achieve their goals.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h5eDt+9ryFtdRhMLSUz5fCs71tk9mCvY5tN4YFgceLM="},"ae5e9fc1-5403-4885-b243-bce44cd43a86":{"id_":"ae5e9fc1-5403-4885-b243-bce44cd43a86","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"LKKF4X7W6mfS6kDk32N5/vP6liBqk90NQlr/fyi187M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e172f359-ee91-4569-a15a-924c2e3db58b","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"h5eDt+9ryFtdRhMLSUz5fCs71tk9mCvY5tN4YFgceLM="}},"text":"Each of these tactics comprise different techniques that may be\r\nused by attackers to achieve their goals.

Data Protection Regulation\r\nGiven the sensitiveness of personal data, its collection, processing, storage, use, and\r\ndestruction must be carefully planned. For enforcing this planning, data protection laws\r\nregulate the privacy of the data subjects [70]. 5.1. Regulatory Measures for Mitigating Data Breaches\r\nA data protection legislation aims to assist in mitigating data leaks by means that\r\nmandate the adoption of preventive security mechanisms. It also aims to reduce the\r\nimpact caused by leaks through timely notifications to regulatory authorities, enabling\r\nappropriate actions to be taken [71]. In this latter scenario, established laws and regulatory\r\nframeworks assist in risk mitigation for both companies and the public sector. Regulations\r\nare commonly rooted in principles such as prevention, accountability, and transparency,\r\nproviding measures to prevent breaches and means to identify and account the responsible\r\nparties. Thus,  principled  interpretations  should  already  aid  in  reducing  incidents  or\r\nmitigating risks, even if a norm is not robust and lacks explicit provisions for data protection,\r\nprocessing, or breach notifications.

Each scenario involves a distinct interpretation and adaptation to the\r\ntypes of leaks occurring, making certain tools more suitable for certain countries. However,\r\nelements like notification and the impact report should be common guidelines across all\r\nregulations concerning data breaches. In some countries, specific regulations exist for specific types of data. In the United\r\nStates, for example, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) regulates data security in publicly listed\r\ncompanies [72], the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) in financial organizations, [73], the\r\nFederal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) in the U.S. federal government\r\nagencies [74], the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in education or-\r\nganizations [75], and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) related to\r\nchildren [76]. However, this work focuses on federal-level data protection laws, and we do\r\nnot discuss sectoral regulations such as the aforementioned. As a reiteration of the importance of data protection legislation, Table 2 compares\r\nthe distribution of data breach costs in lowly and highly regulated environments. The\r\nfinancial impacts of a security breach typically oscillate over time after the incident due\r\nto costs at different stages of the response, such as identification, containment, recovery,\r\nand repair [10]. A more evenly distributed cost, observed in highly regulated areas, will\r\ndilute the financial damage over time, facilitating the subsistence of the organization.

Regulation Levels in the Breached Countries\r\nTo identify the regions that are lowly and highly regulated regarding data protection\r\nand privacy, we briefly compare aspects of the pertinent legislation of all the countries\r\npresent within the dataset. Table 3 summarizes this comparison, in which the rows are\r\nsorted descending by the sum of records leaked. The column ‘Regulation and enforcement’\r\npresents the level of regulation of the country, according to [77], in which (++) represents a\r\nheavy regulation, (+) a robust regulation, (−) moderate, and (−−) limited. A possible analysis for revealing whether legislation is effective in incident mitigation\r\nis a comparison between the frequency and costs of data breaches before and after the\r\nlaw’s enforcement, or even examining how the data protection authority acts in cases of\r\noccurring leaks, the existence of easy notification channels, assessing the impact that these\r\nleaks had on individuals and whether affected people were informed, and adhering to\r\ntransparency and accountability duties.

The law addresses the reparation by the controller or processor that,\r\ndue to the processing of personal data, causes patrimonial, moral, individual, or collective\r\ndamages in violation of the legislation. Thus, non-compliance with good practices, security,\r\nand prevention as envisaged by the law would necessitate damage reparation in the event\r\nof a data leak. Article 48 specifically addresses the notification by the controller of security\r\nincidents to the national authority (ANPD), which may entail risks or relevant harm to data\r\nsubjects. The provision outlines the minimum requirements: (i) description of the nature of\r\nthe affected personal data; (ii) information about the involved data subjects; (iii) indication\r\nof technical and security measures used to protect the data, observing trade and industrial\r\nsecrets; (iv) risks related to the incident; (v) reasons for delay if the communication was\r\nnot immediate; and (vi) measures taken or to be taken to reverse or mitigate the damage\r\neffects. There is no legal deadline for incident notifications to the ANPD. However, the\r\nauthority published guidelines in 2021 stating that communication should be made within\r\ntwo business days from the date of becoming aware of the incident. The institutional\r\nwebsite contains instructions for this notification3, with updated guidelines on violations. In  the  case  of  significant  risk  or  harm  to  data  subjects,  individuals  may  also  need  to\r\nbe notified. The notification can be sent by the Data Protection Officer (DPO) or the\r\nlegal representative, along with the corresponding documentation or authorization. An\r\nadditional recommendation, not legally required, is the implementation of contractual\r\nclauses establishing notification obligations between controllers and processors to expedite\r\nassessment and minimize risks to data subjects. Although it is not necessary to provide a\r\nlist of affected data subjects, the ANPD may request the data controller to present a copy of\r\nthe notification to the data subjects about the breach. This notification to the data subject\r\nshould be made individually, whenever possible, and can be carried out by any means,\r\nsuch as e-mail, letter, or electronic message.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ls0+4eIUK34Vx0lMf83zVv3VCxW739hP+uZr8QGoC6s="},"a1cd4dc6-b9ab-4e4c-b612-d6a1c7a7da9f":{"id_":"a1cd4dc6-b9ab-4e4c-b612-d6a1c7a7da9f","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"tvE3SOQmV0+T8MjWrRKuLqWSPt0Yy77QYIEv1vBENgI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"32c210f4-5fec-4deb-b3c6-a0f8d4163104","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"ls0+4eIUK34Vx0lMf83zVv3VCxW739hP+uZr8QGoC6s="}},"text":"The Indian Law Personal Data Protection Bill in 2019 (PDP), still undergoing updates\r\nin 2022 and considered as a limited regulation (–), was enacted after the Indian Supreme\r\nCourt in 2017 recognized privacy as a fundamental right, enshrined in Article 21 of the\r\nConstitution [77]. There is still no established data protection authority,  which might\r\ncompromise the law’s applicability in data breach construction and mitigation. As observed, both European and Japanese regulations encompass data protection\r\nmeasures concerning prevention, audit, and notification. They also ensure compliance and\r\noversight of legal requirements through national data protection authorities. In contrast,\r\nBrazil, despite modeling its national law after the GDPR and anticipating similar provisions,\r\nremains in a relatively immature regulatory landscape. This is exemplified by the previous\r\nattachment of the national data protection authority to the Presidency of the Republic,\r\nwhich led to increased subordination and limited autonomy in law enforcement [79]. Only\r\nin 2022 did the ANPD gain more autonomy by attaching to the Brazilian Ministry of Justice\r\nand Public Security, albeit without subordination. Conversely, India’s data protection law\r\nwas enacted in 2023 and is yet to be fully implemented [80]. Moreover, the absence of a\r\ndata protection authority underscores its significant immaturity. Consequently, despite the\r\nexistence of laws and security requirements, the lack of effective enforcement, monitoring,\r\nand penalization mechanisms impedes the effective enforcement of data protection. These\r\nmaturity issues are among the possible causes for the classification of Brazil’s and India’s\r\ndata protection regulations at lower levels when compared to Europe’s and Japan’s, for\r\nexample. The United States, despite also not having an enacted federal-level data protection\r\nlaw nor a data protection authority, is considered a country of heavy regulation; this may\r\nbe due to the enactment of the sector-specific laws mentioned in Section 5 and the passing\r\nof state-level data protection laws [81], which demonstrate a greater maturity of the data\r\nprotection regulation in the United States.

A comparison of the maturity levels between the geographical regions, expressed\r\nby the regulation and enforcement levels, is then presented in Figure 11. It is observed\r\nthat all countries in Europe, North America, and Africa apply heavy regulations, while all\r\ncountries in South America and the Caribbean are moderately regulated. Asia Pacific is the\r\nmost diverse region, as it also comprehends a greater number of countries in the dataset. Figure 11.Classification level of regulation and enforcement for countries per region [77]. It is also noted that the Asia Pacific, the only region to have a country with limited\r\nregulation in the dataset, is also the region with a greater median of records breached per\r\nincident, according to Figure 5, with a close value to the median in Europe, a strongly\r\nregulated region. The North America, which is also strongly regulated, presents the lowest\r\nmedian value. When analyzing the median values in countries, from Figure 3, it is observed\r\nthat the top countries are heavily regulated. From this, it may be inferred that regulation\r\nlevels and breach sizes are not strongly correlated. In fact, the amount of data leaked is\r\nmore strongly related to the amount of data stored by the organization. The nature of the\r\nstored data may also influence the breach size, as organizations may apply more efforts\r\nto secure more sensitive data, which could be more severely penalized by data protection\r\nlaws. As an example, medical-related data presented the second lowest median values, as\r\nseen in Figure 6. Following an analysis of Table 3, which is sorted by the sum of breach sizes divided\r\nby the populations sizes in 2019, it is observed that countries with greater regulation and\r\nenforcement levels are more concentrated in the superior lines, which suggests that these\r\ncountries breach a greater number of records per inhabitant than those of lower levels. This\r\nmay be due to several factors. One of them is that developed countries, like the United\r\nStates and those in Europe, are more likely to offer more data-related services, such as cloud\r\nstorage, even for non-residents, which increases the chances of breaches. It may also be a\r\ndirect consequence of a more significant enforcement of breach notification.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NPZFaHfiaj75y8ADt3BW1MUJ0mhgKpHjbggTIDw0GN4="},"d3648096-fe9b-4e53-bad7-cac7d1b16732":{"id_":"d3648096-fe9b-4e53-bad7-cac7d1b16732","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_15","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"jOubtHjIPIxiGnAUHFx9qQcbatlgT0luEsZP7OBSLZE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4fca314b-8784-4f83-80b9-2344579bb72a","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"NPZFaHfiaj75y8ADt3BW1MUJ0mhgKpHjbggTIDw0GN4="}},"text":"It may also be a\r\ndirect consequence of a more significant enforcement of breach notification.

It is noteworthy\r\nthat while Iran is classified as having limited regulation and enforcement regarding data\r\nprotection and privacy, the United States is categorized as a heavily regulated country,\r\npossibly due to the reasons stated in Section 5.2. Moreover, some Member States of the European Union had a national data protection\r\nlaw in effect before the General Data Protection Regulation, some of which still coexist with\r\nthe GDPR. Examples include France’s Loi Informatique et Libertés [85] and Germany’s\r\nBundesdatenschutzgesetz [86].

As\r\nan example, the GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified\r\nor identifiable natural person,  such as name,  date of birth,  email address,  and billing\r\naddress [77]. Brazil’s LGPD does not classify anonymized data as personal information\r\nunless it can be reversed by applying reasonable efforts [77]. Sensitive data may also be defined.

Figure 15 shows the distribution of countries that require data\r\nbreach notification and, among those who do, whether they specify a time limit or not. It is also noteworthy that countries like Chile and Seychelles, although being among the\r\nthree countries with the fewest records breached, do not require notification and, therefore,\r\nmight be under-reporting incidents [92]. Figure 15.Distribution of countries that require breach notification and specify a time limit. 5.3.4. Other Aspects\r\nData protection is a complex matter, and we do not intend to present an exhaustive\r\ncomparison of regulation in these countries but rather discuss some key elements of them. Hereof, the transfer requirements determine the legal aspects that an organization must\r\ncomply with when on-shoring and offshoring data. Especially when transferring data\r\nabroad, additional obligations must be fulfilled. In this scenario, Israeli law mandates that\r\nthe laws of the destination country provide a level of data protection no less stringent than\r\nthat afforded by Israeli law [77]. If that is not the case, at least one of the other criteria must\r\nbe met, such as the data subject’s consent, whether the transfer is vital to public safety,\r\nor others [77]. For enforcement, the public competent entity may apply sanctions to non-compliant\r\norganizations, such as stopping data collection, destruction of personal data collected, and\r\nfinancial penalties in Singapore [77]. The Turkish Criminal Code also punishes a person\r\nwho illegally collects, transfers, publishes, or deletes data with imprisonment [77]. Data protection laws may also apply to electronic marketing. One example of such an\r\napplication is Malaysia’s PDPA, which states that any data subject may require their data\r\nto cease or not to begin processing for direct marketing purposes [77]. 6. Threats to Validity\r\nThe conclusions of this study face threats regarding their validity,  which may be\r\nclassified into four types [93]. External validity. The dataset may have been generated focusing on incidents that\r\nhappened in specific regions, such as countries with greater economies or that may be more\r\nrepresentative in the media. Less publicized breaches that meet the dataset criteria could\r\nhave been omitted. Although the dataset incorporates sources from several languages [14],\r\nthe language barrier also poses a potential external threat to validity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"D1hD2HCDhWbM9WW+T0llgCns2fC2++MF39XNEqHgNhU="},"c1f482ec-cb6c-4bfd-bda5-e468cd6c7d5c":{"id_":"c1f482ec-cb6c-4bfd-bda5-e468cd6c7d5c","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"oCAolUrDCWqHYdNgy1xNO6mt+Ukqcy5y7s7xq3Rp0Zk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9ce5c649-625e-4944-b0f8-87930677a094","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"D1hD2HCDhWbM9WW+T0llgCns2fC2++MF39XNEqHgNhU="}},"text":"This limitation might\r\nresult in less comprehensive coverage of less frequently spoken languages, leading to\r\npotential under-representation of breaches in those linguistic scenarios.

Additionally, the casual relationship between regulation level\r\nin a country and the frequency and impact of a data leak within its jurisdiction is not\r\nalways clear, as other factors, such as population size, may also influence the metrics on\r\nthese incidents. Construct validity. Countries have different definitions for personal data and what\r\nconstitutes a data breach. This threatens the consistency of the incidents between regions. Moreover, a data protection regulation is rich in details and nuances that were not deeply\r\nexplored, potentially affecting the comparability between the discussed regulatory aspects\r\nand the related data violations. Conclusion validity. The dataset may suffer from under-reporting,  especially in\r\ncountries where data breach notification was not legally required between 2018 and 2019. Despite these threats, this study provides valuable insights and promotes the discus-\r\nsion regarding compliance and data protection in the affected countries during the dataset\r\ntime range. 7. Conclusions and Future Work\r\nThis research aimed to visualize worldwide data breaches, especially related to their\r\ngeographical and economic sector occurrences. For that, we used a dataset comprising\r\nthis type of incident that happened between 2018 and 2019 that leaked 30,000 records or\r\nmore [14]. In addition to that, we provided a regulatory discussion in the scope of the\r\naffected countries. This study explores the correlation between data protection enforcement levels and\r\ndata breach occurrences and impacts, and also compares key elements between differ-\r\nent levels of regulations, potentially guiding policy enhancements for improving global\r\ndata protection. Furthermore, these findings can offer valuable insights for organizations\r\nadopting data storage solutions, such as cloud computing models, by aiding in informed\r\ndecisions about where to store sensitive data, considering the nature of the data,the location\r\nof the storage, and its data protection regulation level and history of data confidentiality issues. This investigation identified several strong relationships between countries and eco-\r\nnomic sectors affected by data breaches, such as India, and the medical or healthcare sector;\r\nand Brazil, and the government or military sector. We also observed that leaks affecting\r\neducation records affected North America exclusively in this time frame. A correlation with\r\nthe regulatory aspects in these countries and regions may promote the recognition of root\r\ncauses for data violations and mitigation strategies.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nIU/OfvaOzVmSrv4PXJCDT0NtsEpOtXfdviAqYJpkPo="},"0328ac1f-0e0a-4f15-8d02-3012945b3ffd":{"id_":"0328ac1f-0e0a-4f15-8d02-3012945b3ffd","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"F7neJo8ypdnSpZmXG2vCZVMPu4u98G1WZgdyGRCYLqA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"59759d44-045d-47a8-9ad2-f15b0d78de19","metadata":{"page_number":19,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"nIU/OfvaOzVmSrv4PXJCDT0NtsEpOtXfdviAqYJpkPo="}},"text":"It is relevant to mention, however, that\r\nthese findings heavily rely on the dataset used. Despite the seemingly robust methodology\r\nin data collection, the potential threats to its validity must be considered. These limitations\r\nmight hinder the representation of reality. Given that these patterns are subject to change over time, we propose future research\r\nto extend this study to encompass a broader time frame to validate the aforementioned\r\ndiscoveries. Future work may also enrich the dataset used, including a field that informs\r\nthe cause of the data breach, which would enable a more in-depth discussion regarding\r\nmitigation techniques and the identification of patterns of adversarial procedures per geo-\r\ngraphical region. This enriched dataset could subsequently be fed into machine learning\r\nalgorithms to uncover deeper correlations and predict future occurrences of data leaks. Future research may also focus on the countermeasures, providing more extensive discus-\r\nsion about security controls that may mitigate risks associated to data exposures. On the\r\nregulatory aspects, future work may also compare the impact of the enactment of data\r\nprotection laws on security incidents by analyzing the occurrence of incidents before and\r\nafter they started effects. Overall, the research provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of data\r\nbreaches and their implications for organizations and policymakers. The identified patterns\r\nand correlations can inform data security practices and regulatory frameworks, while the\r\nproposed future research can further advance our knowledge of this critical issue.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1z3SMYQOPA61mRs7aCkGwDvuw1Z/WUN919lOBfRjJ+w="},"900ecba4-7dbd-4722-b08c-b02f9286a3ec":{"id_":"900ecba4-7dbd-4722-b08c-b02f9286a3ec","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf_20","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"3o1CRs1EUCcUkXvPBDsMEIvP63E/sWzjUGotXWZ75Z0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"374ecb11-cd0f-4340-8fa8-73503f5f601e","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"D:\\Ngoding demi kamu shopping\\Data\\Projects\\LlamaIndex Manajemen Insiden\\chatbot-manin\\backend\\data\\Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf","file_name":"Understanding Data Breach from a Global Perspective Incident Visualization and Data Protection Law Review.pdf"},"hash":"tDFwrzFMKuVt5lvJGH6jljMdis6JLw3JBC4OI6MEdhI="}},"text":"Data2023,9, 2720 of 24\r\nAuthor Contributions:G.A.P.R., A.L.M.S. and R.d.O.A. conceived the general composition of the data\r\nbreach study; A.N.L.E.L. conducted the analysis on the data protection laws; E.D.C. and F.L.L.d.M. indicated the methods for the data exploratory analysis; A.L.S.O. and L.J.G.V. conceived and designed\r\nthe experiment.

Most SOCs are designed as\r\na centralized mode which serves for single organization. The single-organisation SOCs face\r\nstructural challenges in addressing operational security scenarios where the incidents span muliple\r\norganisations, andwheretheseorgansiationshabituallydeliverservicesinasynergisticway. Inthis\r\npaper, we propose the distributed security operation center (DSOC) that provides the distributed\r\nworking mechanism for multiple organizations over the wide area network by combining their\r\nsecurity probes. The security probes of DSOC are deployed in the di\u001berent organizations to\r\ncollect data and the collected data is transferred over wide area network to the data analysis center\r\nof the DSOC. Especially, the data communication between security probes and data analysis center\r\nis encrypted to ensure the data security of every organization. The data analysis center adopts rule-\r\nbased, AI-based and threat intelligence-based algorithms to detect cyber-attacks.

Introduction\r\nIHEP su\u001bers frequent attacks by adversaries with di\u001berent agendas. To minimize cybersecurity\r\nrisks and improve the security operations of IHEP, we have created the Security Operation Center\r\n(SOC) in 2021 in IHEP [1], which is a centralized defense group in IHEP based on \u001cve data pro-\r\ncessing layers: data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data analysis and data application. However, the current SOC setup is mainly used for ensuring the network security of one site and\r\nis insu\u001ecient to defend against cyber-attacks for several collaborative large scienti\u001cc facilities and\r\nscienti\u001cc data centers across the wide area network. In this paper, a distributed SOC (DSOC) is proposed which can protect several sites from cyber\r\nthreats and achieve coordinated operation among multiple sites across the wide area network. The\r\nproposed DSOC has three features:\r\n•Multiprobe distributed framework: The proposed DSOC contains a data analysis center in\r\nIHEP and a few security probes in the sites. The data analysis center interacts with security\r\nprobes in client-server mode and integrates data from several sites to achieve multi-site\r\ncollaboration. •Multi-function security probe: The security probe can support network tra\u001ec and security\r\nlogs collection, and perform automatic response at the sites by combining data from the\r\ncentral data analysis center and security devices of sites. In addition, threat intelligence can\r\nbe quickly shared with several sites by using security probe. •Centralized data analysis: The data analysis center can centralize analysis of all site data and\r\ndetect known and unknown attacks in the speci\u001cc security scenarios by rule-based methods\r\nand machine learning algorithms. 2. Related work\r\nSecurity Operations Centers (SOCs) have been created by many organizations or enterprises\r\nas e\u001bective cybersecurity monitoring solutions. D. Crooks presents a minimum viable security\r\noperation senter for the modern grid environment[2, 3]. This security operation senter reference\r\ndesign is based on 4 di\u001berent stages: data sources and threat intelligence, data pipelines, storage\r\nand visualisation, alerting.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jz4VCZhbtw2uOn61inhxLx+yWP+dI0uIiTzhQJ0Gkx4="},"a106fbf0-aac9-4cb0-83a5-ad5396dab6bd":{"id_":"a106fbf0-aac9-4cb0-83a5-ad5396dab6bd","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"WQhm70njIqChvUVr28xOm+guw0LCu/0XA46r2gOcubw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3662d59d-36a5-4015-847c-323093f8369b","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"jz4VCZhbtw2uOn61inhxLx+yWP+dI0uIiTzhQJ0Gkx4="}},"text":"Besides, Bidou presents the implementation of a completely integrated\r\nsecurity operation center (SOC), called SOCBox in order to overcome the limitations of IDS[4, 5].

The Splunk can analyse\r\nand manage logs from multi-customer based on the Splunk agents and universal forwarders. In\r\naddition, the commercial NGSOC[15], T-sec[16], and ISOP[17] can provide the security operations\r\nfor several organizations by using several probes. However, during the trial process of these products\r\nin IHEP, it was found that there were problems such as high deployment and maintenance costs,\r\ninsu\u001ecient scalability, data security risks, and insu\u001ecient timeliness of response, which could not\r\nfully meet the needs of security operations in IHEP. 3. Key techniques of the distributed SOC\r\n3.1 The distributed framework\r\nThe proposed distributed framework includes a server and a few clients. The client is the\r\nsecurity probe deployed in every site and the server is the data analysis center deployed in IHEP. All the sites within the framework are highly collaborative and have mutual trust. To ensure data\r\nsecurity, the transmission between the client and the server is protected. The framework is shown\r\nin \u001cgure 1. Figure 1:The distributed framework\r\nThe functions of security probe mainly include data collection and data application. The data\r\napplication include automatic response and intelligence sharing. The collected data of the security\r\nprobes are encrypted and transmitted to the server. The server then analyzes all site data and\r\nprocesses these data in the threat intelligence platform, the situation awareness system, the threat\r\ndetection and the response services. The comparation between the original SOC and the DSOC\r\nbased on the aforementioned \u001cve data processing sections is shown in \u001cgure 2. All data processing\r\nsections of the original SOC are deployed in IHEP, but parts of data processing sections of the\r\nDSOC are deployed in every site. 3","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AQpbQCUIsjALCmvHAaADg/NE61AehSo4QsFxDZMomfk="},"46963159-dbf9-49e1-a071-41e4433030a6":{"id_":"46963159-dbf9-49e1-a071-41e4433030a6","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"bWwHDfQxgbt/6+JRbQPnZI5mxvRr7QE/YPjC3TozEkc="}},"text":"PoS(ISGC&HEPiX2023)026\r\nA distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy PhysicsJiarong Wang\r\nData collectionData preprocessingData storageData analysisData applications\r\nData collectionData preprocessingData storageData analysisData applicationsDeployed in IHEP\r\nDeployed in Sites\r\nThe original SOC\r\nThe Distributed SOC (DSOC)\r\nFigure 2:Comparation between the original SOC and the DSOC\r\nThe DSOC uses di\u001brent technologies to build \u001cve data processing sections as shown in \u001cgure\r\n3.

The rule-based data analysis uses the known attack features to detect speci\u001cc attack patterns. For example, the log4j2 vulnerability attack can be detected from the network tra\u001ec if the http\r\nprotocol network packets contain string like 'jndi:ldap://' or 'jndi:rmi', and we use the feature string\r\nin the detection rule. The threshold-based data analysis compares the statistics with the speci\u001cc threshold to detect\r\nattacks. For example, the brute force attack detection for login servers counts the number of login\r\nfailures, and if the number is larger than the threshold, the login IP address is detected as a malicious\r\nIP.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gGbBOr2WDso46FgNRrPxY4SLDbG7p/NEGJ6LdMesEc8="},"429e8e8c-4353-4489-b6d1-5743a77a8690":{"id_":"429e8e8c-4353-4489-b6d1-5743a77a8690","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"BGoxz9aVdKSeDC64Gpvm3yfYbuO+C8kZauNq8lhYBEA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"69ee792b-cc7c-42a6-a8c9-9d93dd1822fe","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"gGbBOr2WDso46FgNRrPxY4SLDbG7p/NEGJ6LdMesEc8="}},"text":"The detection \u001dow is shown in \u001cgure 5.䇴༽ޞᆿ㠠ࣞሷ䬷㊱ශૂሷ䬷ᆔ⮛\r\n⭞ֵᕧਙԚȽ\r\nthresholdThe\u0003number\u0003of\u0003failuresLogin\u0003IP\u0003address\r\nLogin\u0003failure\r\nSSH\u0003login\u0003dataset\r\nBlack\u0003IP\u0003database\r\n\u0003\r\n\u0003㠠ࣞሷ䬷㊱ශૂሷ䬷ᆔ⮛\r\nͲ\u0003\r\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\r\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\r\n\u0003\r\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\r\n\u0003\u0003\r\n\u0003\r\n\u0003\u0003\r\nȽ\r\nFigure 5:The brute force attack detection for login servers\r\nThe AI-based data analysis deploys anomaly detection algorithms and deep neural network\r\nto detect attacks.

In addition, we adopt dynamic\r\nblocking strategy which includes 6 blocking levels: 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year,\r\ninde\u001cnitely respectively. 3.6 Threat intelligence\r\nThe functions of the threat intelligence platform can be classi\u001ced as four parts. The \u001crst part\r\nis threat intelligence collection which aggregates threat intelligence from two sources. One source\r\nis the malicious IP database which stores the detected and blocked IP addresses from all sites. The\r\nother source is the security related websites which post the malicious IP dataset periodically such\r\nas structured data feeds. The second part of the threat intelligence platform is threat intelligence\r\nstorage which builds a graph database [25] to store the collected threat intelligence based on the\r\nSTIX standard [26]. The third part is threat intelligence sharing in which security probes pull threat\r\nintelligence from the threat intelligence database. The last part is the threat intelligence application\r\nwhich uses the malicious IP for the threat detection and automatic blocking. 3.7 Security situation awareness\r\nThe security situation awareness can provide the overview of security status of every site by\r\nvisualizing several statistics, such as the number of threats, the trends of threats, and the origins\r\nof threats. The used technologies include Django framework [27], Vue.js [28] and Echarts [29].

For example, a user's email account was leaked because of phishing mail. And\r\nthen the intruder logged into his account at mid-night. The DSOC detected the unusual login and\r\nsent an alert email to the user. This user read our notice in the morning and changed his password. For the security alerts logs such as network intrusion detection system (NIDS), host intrusion\r\ndetection system (HIDS), web application \u001crewall (WAF) and intrusion prevention system (IPS),\r\nthe DSOC can \u001clter 99% false positives and perform automatic response. For example, the DSOC\r\ncounts the number of backdoor attacks and compares with a threshold. If the number is larger than\r\nthe threshold, the attack IP of backdoor attack is blocked automatically. In addition, the DSOC also analyzes DNS logs of sites to detect DNS \u001dood attack. The DSOC\r\n\u001crstly counts the number of DNS queries. If the number is larger than the threshold, the DNS \u001dood\r\nattack is detected and the attack IP is blocked automatically if the queries are from the external IP,\r\nbut if the queries are from the internal IP, the DSOC sends alerts emails to security manager to\r\nhandle. 6","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"EYH5SAp23QciRwXPIlse6Rr4gzTO3PucSHS0flvmmX0="},"2c4cb817-1988-4808-b3b0-ba463f7eacd8":{"id_":"2c4cb817-1988-4808-b3b0-ba463f7eacd8","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf_7","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"6baUGzr7LENjrSh5nUUU2HUrJYhfErlkiWtAj5EiwWA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"96bea7bf-5819-44cf-8c97-bdf801104127","metadata":{"page_number":7,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf","file_name":"A distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy Physics.pdf"},"hash":"4jx8tgsIvylRe2K/awzT6Z12WKqqxmUiDf5q9wCNQkA="}},"text":"PoS(ISGC&HEPiX2023)026\r\nA distributed framework for security operation center in the application of Institute of High Energy PhysicsJiarong Wang\r\nNgsoc\u0003(network\u0003intrusion\u0003\r\ndetection\u0003system)\r\nKafka\r\nThreshold\u0003detection\r\nAutomatic\u0003blocking\r\nZeek\u0003\r\nLog\u0003server\r\nAlerts\u0003statistics\r\nCDN\u0003extraction\r\nwhitelist\r\nBlacklist\u0003\r\nLogin\u0003server\r\nAbnormal\u0003DNS\u0003detection\u0003\r\nWAF\u0003(Web\u0003application\u0003\r\nfirewall)\r\nAttackers\u0003\r\nLog4j2\u0003detection\r\nPreprocessing\u0003\r\nOverview\u0003of\u0003\r\nsecurity\u0003status\r\nTian\u0003(Host\u0003Intrusion\u0003\r\nDetection\u0003System)\r\nHTTP\u0003traffic\u0003logs\r\nDNS\u0003traffic\u0003logs\r\nLogin\u0003logs\r\nAlerts\u0003logs\r\nIPS\u0003(Intrusion\u0003prevention\u0003\r\nsystem)\r\nEmail\u0003server\r\nSSO\u0003(Single\u0003signͲon)\u0003server\r\nLogstash\r\nAttacks\u0003statistics\r\nSend\u0003alert\u0003\r\nemailsBrute\u0003force\u0003\r\ndetection\r\nAbnormal\u0003login\u0003\r\ndetection\r\nDNS\u0003serverDNS\u0003logs\r\nDNS\u0003flood\u0003detection\r\nWhitelist\u0003filter\r\nElasticsearch\r\nSQL\r\nData\u0003monitoring\u0003=0\r\nData\r\nStorage\r\nAnalysis\r\nApplication\r\nServers\r\nFigure 6:Data \u001dow diagram for the DSOC in IHEP\r\nThe automatic blocking of sites has 4 steps in general.

Owning a Security Operation Center (SOC) is becoming \r\nincreasingly common for organizations as part of their cybersecurity \r\nstrategy to ensure near-real-time detection and adequately respond to \r\ncyber-attack engaging the SOC’s humans, technology, and processes. However, SOC investments only sometimes achieve the best possible \r\noutcomes and only provide an acceptable protection level in some cases \r\ndue to the challenges related to the technologies, processes and especially \r\nthe human factor. This paper proposes a new practical maturity framework \r\nfor Security Operation Center. This will serve as a roadmap for IT auditors \r\nand security experts when they evaluate the maturity of a security \r\noperation center in terms of safeguarding the assets of the company, its \r\npartners, and its clients. INTRODUCTION\r\nSecurity operations centers should be analyzed as a management \r\ntool for the continuity and quality of the organizations’ opera-\r\ntions. Their inclusion in their organizational structure will allow \r\norganizations to achieve their strategic objectives.

Computer security requires a combination of technical knowledge \r\nof all computer platforms and management knowledge to articulate \r\ndevices, technologies, advanced detection systems, processes, and \r\npeople. In this way, it will be possible to effectively and sustainably \r\nprotect the assets of interest to the organization (Maleh, 2018). A SOC is a team of security experts in charge of monitoring, \r\ndetecting, analyzing and qualifying security events. This team \r\nensures the management of appropriate reactions to proven secur-\r\nity incidents. For some organizations, this team administers and \r\ncontrols the day-to-day management of security systems and mea-\r\nsures; for example, the “hardening” of standard operating systems \r\nto reinforce their security, or the management of accreditations \r\n(access rights to resources) or even the management of “patch \r\nmanagement. ” In direct support of the business and partnership \r\nwith IT services, a SOC aims to reduce the duration and the impact \r\nof security incidents that take advantage of, disrupt, prevent, \r\ndegrade or destroy systems dedicated to standard operations. This is achieved through effective monitoring and tracking of inci-\r\ndents from end to end. The SOC is responsible, on the one hand, for \r\ndeclaring that there is indeed an incident on the IS, and, on the \r\nother hand, it is responsible for conducting the operations that will \r\nenable it to declare the incident closed. From an operational point \r\nof view, it is the combination of the SOC and CERT/C-SIRT entities \r\nthat ensures the resolution of an incident (Maleh, 2021). The overall objective of the paper is to demonstrate that \r\na security operations center (SOC) is a management solution to \r\nthe problem of cyber defense. To achieve the general objective, it \r\nwill be necessary to address the first specific objective, which is to \r\nintroduce security operations, including the reasons behind creat-\r\ning a SOC and its services. Then we will move on to the second \r\nspecific objective, which is to explain the triad of processes, people \r\nand technologies, whose synergy and interaction support the man-\r\nagement of a SOC. Finally, the third specific objective will be devel-\r\noped to outline the strategy for creating a maturity model for SOC.

Looking back, it is \r\npossible to identify different generations or levels of maturity of \r\nsecurity operations centers. The first generation of what we know today as a security opera-\r\ntions center (SOC) was a set of responsibilities scattered among \r\nareas of the systems department exercised by people whose pri-\r\nmary task was other and who were therefore not trained or \r\nsecurity aware. Their tasks consisted of monitoring network \r\ndevices and servers to ensure the availability of services, basic \r\nadministration of antivirus systems, and a limited collection of \r\naudit logs for network devices.

Deploying a Security Operations Center (SOC) is crucial \r\nfor businesses to meet and overcome cyber security threats. The \r\noriginal notion of a SOC was founded mostly on the reactive sig-\r\nnaling of events. With time, the SOC has expanded its purview to \r\nencompass incident response, proactive research, and crime pre-\r\nvention. The growth and efficiency of a SOC are driven by its \r\nability to get greater visibility into network traffic and operations, \r\nrespond quickly to security incidents, and deliver reliable threat \r\nintelligence. In light of the changes above and the IT auditor’s position as \r\na reliable service provider, it’s important to disseminate best \r\npractices for evaluating SOC efficiency. Existing best practice fra-\r\nmeworks (i.e., ISO2700, CobiT, or NIST-CSF) do not provide in- \r\ndepth examinations of SOC operations, alignment, and maturity; \r\nhence, the SOC-MF was developed for this purpose. In light of the changes above and the IT auditor’s position as \r\na reliable service provider, it’s important to disseminate best prac-\r\ntices for evaluating SOC efficiency.

Design \r\nScience was used to develop the suggested SOC model for matur-\r\nity, which is an artifact that bridges the gap between theory and \r\npractice (Alharbi, 2020)(. SOC maturity model artifacts include \r\nthe model and a self-assessment tool for quantitative evaluation. The SOC capability Maturity model was developed after consider-\r\nable research of the available literature. All elements found in the \r\nliterature were tested for occurrence in actual SOCs by conducting \r\na survey among 16 participant organizations. SOC capability \r\nmaturity model was developed using data gathered from the \r\nstudy. This model contains 4 domains and 25 aspects or elements \r\nand is shown in Table 1 below.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"edcQRgAHtjrGST3GfFgN5BCQGMeGjx8bnlJj6/y82UY="},"a3ea0a63-d3a6-4c6f-b19a-26426b1d06bc":{"id_":"a3ea0a63-d3a6-4c6f-b19a-26426b1d06bc","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf","file_name":"A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf","file_name":"A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"YCWHF5y6iB0EEK8p9/iiIAWku5KPyRGSMiATDa8EW6w="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"87ccd7b2-7b2e-4973-abd1-d0b7e7ed1276","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf","file_name":"A MATURITY CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY OPERATION CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"edcQRgAHtjrGST3GfFgN5BCQGMeGjx8bnlJj6/y82UY="}},"text":"Framework Maturity Profile\r\nTo put it simply, cybersecurity in 2022 is unsustainable due to the \r\never-changing nature of the threats that must be dealt with.

However, it is possible to go \r\na little further and extend the area of responsibility of such \r\na center beyond just information security to cover related areas \r\nsuch as technical security, physical security, consolidation of \r\nvideo surveillance data, control of equipment management sys-\r\ntems (power, ventilation, fire-fighting equipment, and many \r\nothers). As a result, an information security incident monitoring \r\nand response center grows into an organization’s situational or \r\ncrisis management center.

The \r\ndata center task is also a data service organization that needs to \r\ndo data publishing services among their stakeholders. The \r\nchallenging task for the Security Operation Center (SOC) team \r\nis to analyze all security risks such as data breaches. Most cases \r\nof data breach problems are overlooked cases that occur \r\nindirectly by guessing from other prior knowledge. For \r\nexample, attackers combine our dataset with other data sets to \r\nreidentify personal data. This attack is called a re-Identification \r\nattack that causes a data breach. To fix the risk, statistical noise \r\ncontrol techniques for data anonymization are explored and \r\nimplemented in this study. A Cell-key perturbation is to fix the \r\nattack without modifying an original dataset but return an \r\nanswer dataset with noise addition per query instead.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThe UK Statistics and Registration Services Act's \r\nresponsibility is to produce official statistics and ensure good \r\npractice usage of statistics. In these acts (2007), “personal \r\ninformation” is information that identifies directly or \r\nindirectly a particular person. Data privacy laws such as \r\nGDPR [18] in Europe and PDPA [19] in Thailand are both \r\nlaws to protect personal data. Since then, data privacy has \r\nbecome a hot topic in many countries. The difference between data security and data privacy is \r\n‘Who’ can access data in data security and ‘when and what \r\ncan they access data in data privacy. For example, login \r\nauthentication term in data security is about ‘Who’ can access \r\nbut Authorization in data privacy is about ‘what’ and ‘when’ \r\nof data that the user is accessible. Therefore, data privacy is a \r\ntask for the SOC team rather than an individual system \r\nadministrator.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cuCRpvVLlawSiuBgIBIaEbRIBrTRKhThXA4Dmd4YtMo="},"9513a4ed-8f26-47ee-9c2f-2002e383f716":{"id_":"9513a4ed-8f26-47ee-9c2f-2002e383f716","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"nsy5R0arPe1GtTz52Sullr8gb2xs/MAaPz9A9YEkOlk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a829072-0540-462b-96b1-963f566a5b58","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"cuCRpvVLlawSiuBgIBIaEbRIBrTRKhThXA4Dmd4YtMo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9c11a059-27ca-432b-a0d3-51004a258dbc","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"cLgtlIrMHFF+XcQ6UvykOfLwhliXPIKd9S5qJXcA3KQ="}},"text":"Therefore, data privacy is a \r\ntask for the SOC team rather than an individual system \r\nadministrator. According to The National Institute of Standards and \r\nTechnology Framework (NIST), it is almost inevitable for a \r\nfirm to have a data breach. This paper intends to propose a \r\nnew framework for mitigating a data breach effect. Thailand \r\nPDPA laws argue the data controller to notify the data breach \r\nincident within 72 hours after detecting the event. The basic approach to preventing data breaches is to hide \r\nPersonal Identifier Information (PII) from being exposed by \r\nothers without permission. For example, all PIIs are separately \r\nstored on different tables. Unfortunately, the datasets that \r\nexclude PII combined with other knowledge can reveal \r\nunintentionally the personal data. Because data breach causes \r\nserious problem by-laws, this research proposed a new \r\nframework to protect personal data and comply with privacy \r\nlaws. For example, attackers combine our dataset with other \r\ndata sets to reidentify personal data. This attack is called a re-\r\nIdentification risk [9] that causes a data breach. Data center becomes a data controller or data processor by \r\nGDPR/PDPA laws because it holds a lot of personal data. PDPA is a new data privacy law in Thailand. The riskiest data \r\ncontroller is a data breach. The simple way of protecting data \r\nis cyber security, but there is no guarantee for data privacy. The incident response model was developed based on the \r\nprocedures and policies that were implemented within the \r\ninstitution. Once an incident happens, the SOC has to team \r\ndetermine the adjustments needed for the controls that will be \r\nimplemented in different processes whether for technical or \r\nnontechnical aspects. Fig. 1. RSU Incident Management Process \r\nFigure 1 shows the RSU incident management process that \r\nhandles some serious incidents such as data breaches. By \r\nThailand law, the data controller has to report the data owner \r\nwithin 72 hours.

Rather than using the data swapping technique, \r\nthe Cell Key Perturbation Methodology is much faster. The CKP method adds a small amount of noise to some \r\ncells in a table, meaning that users cannot be sure whether \r\ndifferences between tables  represent  a  real  person,  or  are \r\ncaused  by  the perturbation. The  method is  consistent  and \r\nrepeatable, so the same cells are always perturbed in the same \r\nway [4]. Cell Key Perturbation Methodology is to add statical noise \r\nto a dataset that can be reidentified. The key concept is to \r\nmake a long time for attackers to reveal their original personal \r\ndata. Fig. 2. Frequency count on quasi-identifier \r\nFigure 2 shows a re-identification risk on the frequency of \r\ngroup 1 by using the group-by command. Attackers can guess \r\nwho they are if they are unique. A simple group-by-command \r\ncannot reveal all other dimensions; therefore, a Perturbation \r\ntable or P-table is invented for multidimensional calculation. A perturbation table applied to a cell is a frequency table that \r\ncounts a group of attributes. Such a P-table can be obtained \r\nusing the R-package P-table [3]. The record keys are random values for each record. When \r\ncalculating a table cell, these record keys will be combined \r\ninto a cell key. The noise added is based on a cell’s value and \r\na ‘cell key’ calculated for each cell. Cell key values are not \r\nunique and the same noise can be added to multiple cells. It is \r\nimportant to note that the noise is not added randomly: if the \r\nsame query is run multiple times, the query will always be \r\nperturbed in the same way. In order to apply the cell key method, a microdata file must \r\nbe  supplied  containing  categorical  data. An  unperturbed \r\nfrequency table is generated based on the variables defined, \r\nthen a ‘cell key’ for each value is calculated by summing the \r\nrecord keys - integers randomly assigned to each row - from \r\nthe contributing rows in the source microdata. A lookup is \r\nthen performed on a perturbation table such as a CSV file \r\ncontaining a list of perturbation values specifying how much \r\nnoise  should  be  applied  to  a  cell.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kX0dXmZDJt7lvoXpiMDMjJ3QbrFk7Iusv5a7h/Ly7tE="},"304c0acd-9ecd-4ed4-b335-311e0341ab28":{"id_":"304c0acd-9ecd-4ed4-b335-311e0341ab28","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"97Fd06uMAMXKyhVJEVI8sNIOOzGMbRuM8jatK1m2TIE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dba16c98-a7a5-4d6e-a1bc-233ff871d570","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"kX0dXmZDJt7lvoXpiMDMjJ3QbrFk7Iusv5a7h/Ly7tE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c85434a2-7f37-4044-b00b-8f10073d7c43","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"HSXKIAZ6XXV3TXjXzp+KeLbDkGE2Rf0oIgfl5rR0GE4="}},"text":"The  final  output  is  a \r\nperturbed frequency table that is no longer disclosive.

METHODOLOGY \r\nAccording  to  GDPR  laws,  Personal  Identification \r\nInformation (PII) has to be stored secretly away from hackers; \r\ntherefore, they have to be decomposed from the original data. In this process, the SOCs team has to decompose the original \r\ndata into two segments including the PII segment and the non-\r\nPII segment. For the non-PII segment, we need to add noise to \r\nmitigate  and re-Identification risk. In  this  experiment,  the \r\nSOC team applied additive noise to the numerical attributes. The following steps are the data preparation process. Firstly, \r\nPII has to be identified and then separated into a new secret \r\ntable. Secondly, Cell Key Perturbation Methodology [2] is \r\napplied to the non-PII segment to prevent re-Identification \r\nrisk. Fig. 3. Privacy data segmentation process \r\nA. Statistical Noise control technique \r\nThe Cell-key method is one of the Statistical Noise control \r\ntechniques to protect data privacy. The random record key to \r\nevery data record acts as an index of the cells of a pre-defined \r\nperturbation table. In order to return the same answer on the same query, \r\nthe Cell-key method intend to assign permanently the record \r\nkey to each record. These row keys are used to generate \r\nconsistent values for the perturbation. Whenever the same \r\nquery, the same perturbation will be applied. Cell-key perturbation[13] is a technique used to protect \r\nsensitive data by adding random noise to the original data \r\nvalues. Perturbation of zeros is a specific type of cell-key \r\nperturbation where random noise is added to the cells of a \r\ndataset that contain zero values. The purpose of perturbing \r\nzero cells is to protect the privacy of individuals by preventing \r\nattackers from inferring any sensitive information from the \r\nabsence of data.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"U5vq9DmmMt3PDc4Ptc4Xn29/VOEMj9snkLswy1BFQP4="},"76ec015f-58ac-433d-81cd-dab7832c3b50":{"id_":"76ec015f-58ac-433d-81cd-dab7832c3b50","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"vm6z2PwWecDBy81OKRVBo0DMVj5u5XObmrBhlGIdbF8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"58863021-87e3-4efd-93b1-101ccd11d681","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"U5vq9DmmMt3PDc4Ptc4Xn29/VOEMj9snkLswy1BFQP4="}},"text":"By using R-key indexes, the frequency of the group was \r\ncounted and summed into an integer number and then divided \r\nby modulo arithmetic to produce a cell-level key to determine \r\nthe perturbation.

Cell-key perturbation method \r\nFigure 4 shows the Cell-key perturbation process by using \r\nR-key and P-table. The goal of the P-table package is to \r\nproduce perturbation tables that can be used for applying noise \r\nto statistical tables. V. EXPERIMENT \r\nPython is a language to demonstrate our methodology in \r\nthis study because of its flexibility and its ability to data \r\nmanipulation. However,  it  is  not  suitable  for  commercial \r\nproducts and is not intended to be. This study is to demonstrate \r\nthe concept of cell-key perturbation. Commercial tools are \r\navailable such as an R-package and τ -argus. Jupyter Notebook tool and python are implemented in this \r\nexperiment to demonstrate a key concept. Pandas is a built-in \r\npackage in the Jupyter Notebook. From de-identified data in \r\nsection IV, the panda's crosstab () function in Python is used \r\nto build a frequency table in a cross-tabulation table form. It \r\ncan show the frequency with which certain groups of data. A \r\nfamous adult dataset is chosen because it contains a lot of \r\nquasi-identifier attributes such as {age, sex, race}. The set of \r\nthree variables is a quasi-identifier because it is a minimal set. The cell key perturbation method is as following steps: \r\nA. Step 1: Create a record key by assigning a random \r\nnumber between 0 and 99. The R-key package in Figure 2 generates a row-key to use \r\nin a frequency table. The row key is added to a non-PII \r\nsegment. The  larger  the  random  number,  the  longer \r\ncomputation is. Only two digits between 0 and 99 is chosen as \r\na random number range. Fig. 5. Excerpt from experiment script in Step 1 \r\nB. Step 2: Create a frequency table using the crosstab \r\nfunction. In this step, a P-table is constructed, and the crosstab \r\nfunction is used to count the frequency of the cell values \r\ngroup. Fig. 6. Excerpt from experiment script in Step 2 \r\nC. Step 3: Calculate perturbation values on the frequency \r\ntable from cell value and cell key.

Step 5: Generate new anonymized dataset. The final step is to construct an anonymized dataset that \r\nlies in front of a firewall. Unlike another method, this method \r\nintends  to  add  minimal  noise  to  the  original  dataset. The \r\nadvantage of this method is most of the cells are not modified \r\ncalled “Zero cells”. The other word not all cells are modified. This  experiment  shows  an  output  from  the Jupyter \r\nNotebook. Fig. 9. Unperturbed and Perturbed table output \r\nFigures 9 (a) and 9 (b) show the output generated for all 3 \r\nvariables before and after perturbation respectively.

VI. FUTURE WORK. The perturbation of zeros is a specific type of Cell-key \r\nperturbation  used  in  data  privacy  and  security  to  protect \r\nsensitive information. If we perturb all rows, it damages data utility. Data privacy \r\ntries to preserve some risk groups. In our case, f=1. The effect \r\nof using the perturbation of zeros is that it adds random noise \r\nto  the  cells  of  a  dataset  that  contain  zero  values.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"QUtS8E3ZpyIk6It9Gem4h1wsOtmUno+uFAth5aXzUIk="},"9a5cd8a7-a379-48b6-bbca-f739cd4633b7":{"id_":"9a5cd8a7-a379-48b6-bbca-f739cd4633b7","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"h2Nmcc+wjqMEDWpbX9Bdo2MsHbTeKRYmpuTZtAjHJzA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f4a5bc65-0107-4261-93f7-9cf83aa2f134","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"QUtS8E3ZpyIk6It9Gem4h1wsOtmUno+uFAth5aXzUIk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8b350ba5-d99f-4d77-abb5-af3e10420264","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf","file_name":"Cell-key Perturbation Data Privacy Procedure for Security Operations Center Team (1).pdf"},"hash":"0+LhuGreCF32P7qBD+VTgt/z1CCKbxL6mcwTehFVu9U="}},"text":"The \r\nperturbation of zeros is however out of scope in this paper. We \r\nwill cope with these issues in our future work. Cell-key perturbation is a technique that is widely used in \r\nEurope. Comparing performance with an existing algorithm is \r\ndifficult because Cell-key perturbation is an alternative way to \r\nhandle the differencing attacks. Therefore, we hope to make a \r\nperformance comparison in future work. VII. CONCLUSION \r\nCell-key  perturbation data  privacy  procedure  for  the \r\nSecurity  Operations  Center  Team  is  explained  and \r\nimplemented in this paper. In Figure 4, attackers cannot be so \r\nsure  whether  the  information in  the  table  are  affected by \r\nperturbation or its original values. Some of cells are added \r\nwith noise. perturbation tables (p-tables) are a goal of the Cell-\r\nkey  method. Jupyter  Notebook tool  and Python are \r\nimplemented to compute perturbation tables. The anonymizer server in Figure 2 was designed to allow \r\nusers to do queries online. Consistency is so important for \r\nonline service. The same user will get the same anonymized \r\ndataset  all  the  time;  therefore,  the Cell-key  perturbation \r\nmethod is a suitable answer for E-Commerce service. The \r\nserver performs data preparation in section 4 and then runs \r\nCell Key Perturbation in section 5. REFERENCES \r\n[1] D. Shahjee, N.

A SOC can be defined as a centralized location inside or out of an\r\norganisation comprising of people, processes and technology with the sole\r\npurpose of helping businesses to maintain cyber situational awareness, address\r\ncompliance issue and threat management [1].

Background\r\nPrevious studies on SOCs suggest that people, processes and technology are at\r\nthe center of a SOC and that the success of a SOC is dependent on these three\r\nelements [6]. Setting up or operating a SOC is an expensive venture and\r\nbusinesses continually evaluate their return on security investment and how\r\nto improve overall performance [5]. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing\r\nthe performance of SOCs, the industry generally rely on statistical data gener-\r\nated from deployed technological solutions such asfirewalls, Intrusion\r\nDetection Systems (IDSs’) and vulnerability scanners to determine or assess\r\nefficiencies [7]. The problem with this approach is that it fails to take into\r\nconsideration human factors (the human security analysts or people). People\r\n(SOC analysts) are key to maintaining deployed security controls, the investiga-\r\ntion of threats and incident management of all suspicious activities [8].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vLg6b8KV2d7tXcoDJZXtKwKsJbpK8y9itvFM8ALVGQ0="},"0a539828-dfb7-48b8-a2b3-c82e15ab6d3b":{"id_":"0a539828-dfb7-48b8-a2b3-c82e15ab6d3b","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"a/CYMrLzWujOTozCRCYNEAMFT7zgV4Hw0wr7Q5PasKM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"75b5c7fc-6dce-4d4f-b70c-f66b5bccbae2","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"vLg6b8KV2d7tXcoDJZXtKwKsJbpK8y9itvFM8ALVGQ0="}},"text":"Additionally, SOCs rely on a human to outsmart a malicious attacker [1].

McClain et al. [10], stress that analysts performance is a pertinent issue in\r\ncybersecurity as they play a crucial role in operating and maintaining the tools\r\nused by businesses to detect and respond to cyber threats. Analysts are\r\nexpected to monitor, detect, analyze and report cyber threat [6]. Also, analysts\r\nare supposed to have a greater cyber situational awareness and the necessary\r\nskills to detect attacks [4]. These responsibilities and tasks make it essential for\r\nanalysts to maintain a high standard of operational effectiveness and perfor-\r\nmance as a poor operational performance will hinder the overall efficiency of\r\na SOC [7]. One would expect analysts to receive various forms of support and\r\nongoing training to realize their objectives in the SOC. However, defending against cyber-attacks is not a trivial task and analysts face\r\nnumerous challenges, many of which affect their performance. For example, [8]\r\npoint out the complexity and intensity of the work of analysts. Similarly, the\r\nvolume of alerts/security events presented to the analysts, along with the multi-\r\nfaceted nature of cyber attacks all presents an enormous challenge to the analysts\r\n[4,11]. There are also issues and challenges arising from human factors such as\r\nstress level of the analysts, vigilance, mental workload, fatigue along with organi-\r\nsational processes and technological factors that impact on analysts performance\r\n[4,12]. While these may just be instances of what may well be part of a bigger\r\nproblem, and in some cases leading to analysts burnout [7,13,14], it remains\r\nunclear whether researchers and practitioners have a comprehensive insight into\r\nchallenges faced by analysts from human, organisational and technological\r\nperspective. Effort to understand the challenges faced by analysts are scattered across\r\nliterature, disjointed and often do not provide a comprehensive view of the\r\nissue. Hámornik and Krasznay [15], state that SOCs face internal and external\r\nissues. According to Lif and Sommestad [4], extant literature contains a few pieces\r\nof information on the challenges faced by analysts.

We define a measure as a concrete, quantifiable\r\nand objective attribute such as the number of incidents raised by analysts and\r\na metric as an abstract, somewhat subjective attribute that can have many\r\nmeasures, for example, monitoring function metrics. In other words, measures\r\nsupport metrics [18]. The word performance in this context, as defined by the\r\nOxford English Dictionary, refers to the action or process of performing a task or\r\nfunction. Even though researchers have proposed various metrics for assessing the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of a SOC, these assessment methods do not always\r\ntake analysts effort and performance into consideration. For example, Jacobs\r\net al. [2], presents a metric for evaluating the performance of a SOC based on the\r\ncapability services provided and maturity levels, but do not discuss assessment\r\nmethod (measures or metrics) for the analysts performance. Similarly, Schinagl,\r\nSchoon and Paans [1], also propose a performance metric for SOCs, but their\r\nwork does not adequately present a formal quantitative method for measuring\r\nthe efforts of analysts. Some scholars, however, have identified a number of\r\nways by which analysts efforts can be evaluated. These writers, however, often\r\ndo not differentiate between metrics and measures. In most cases, the terms\r\nmeasures and metrics are blurred and used interchangeably by the writers [5–7]. For example, some authors suggest the number of incidents raised or closed\r\nper day as a metric for the analysts [6]. Others focus on the time taken by an\r\nanalyst to detect an incident [5,7]. Based on our definition, these are measures\r\nrather than metrics. Moreover, analysts tasks are not limited to incidents raised\r\nor closed. The evidence from the literature also suggests that analysts are not\r\nsatisfied with this kind of measures as it does not take into consideration several\r\naspects of their work [7]. A much more worrying concern that literature posits is\r\nthat SOC Managers also lament about the lack of good metrics for assessing\r\nanalysts [7]. Despite the important role played by analysts, research continues to focus\r\nexclusively on building blocks for SOC, SOC framework and SOC technologies [1].

Review process\r\nAs the SOC industry matures, studies,findings and reports on SOCs has also\r\nincreased, hence there is a need to provide an overview of a SOC in the context\r\nof our research. To do this, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). A SystematicLiteratureReview provides a methodological process ofgatheringall\r\navailable or the majority of literature on a topic and analyzing them to address\r\na specific question/s [19]. The SLR process allows evidence to be gathered to\r\nprovide informative and evidence-based answers to research questions [20]. Three main research questions were defined to guide the systematic review\r\nprocess:\r\n●Research Question 1 (RQ1): What are the main challenges facing SOC analysts? ●Research Question 2 (RQ2): What metrics exist to measure the performance\r\nof a SOC analyst? ●Research Question 3 (RQ3): What is the mapping between the challenges faced\r\nby analysts and existing analyst performance metrics? In other words, we\r\nwould like to know whether there is a metric(s) for assessing the analyst\r\nperformance as he/she addresses the challenging aspects of their work identi-\r\nfied in RQ1. The literature search was focused on publications that investigate metrics for\r\nSOCs, the SOC analyst and analysts’challenges. Our search strategy was devised\r\nin collaboration with a subject specialist librarian and selected papers from top\r\nscientific databases such as Scopus, Institute of Electrical and Electronics\r\nEngineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library, Association of Computing Machinery\r\n(ACM) Digital Library, and ScienceDirect. These databases were selected\r\nbecause they cover the major conferences and journals, and are amongst the\r\ntop databases for Computer Science research [21,22]. In addition, we also\r\nsearched Google Scholar and Google search engine to increase the breadth of\r\nour search. Keywords used are security operations center; cyber security; cyber\r\noperations; security analysts; performance metrics; systematic literature review. The Google search engine was used to search for grey literature and non-\r\nacademic papers.

Although there is no standardised quality assessment\r\ntool, Dybå and Dingsøyr along with CASP provide some vital quality assessment\r\nchecklist which has been used by various researchers conducting systematic\r\nreviews in severalfields [27]. Our checklist, which is adapted from the work of\r\nDybå and Dingsøyr [25], is made up of 12 items as shown inTable 2. However,\r\nonly one criterion was used as the basis for including or excluding a paper. This\r\napproach is similar to the strategy used by Dybå and Dingsøyr [25]. Notwithstanding, some scholars argue that a checklist cannot be used to assess\r\nquality [20]. However, from our perspective, using a single criterion allowed us\r\nto access a sufficient number of literature until saturation points where an\r\nadditional study will not provide any new information [31]. We initiallyassessed the quality ofeach paper by answering the questions from\r\nthe checklist and assigning scores based on a three-point scale of Yes (Y) = 1, No\r\nor Not Reported (N) = 0 and Partially (P) = 0.5 to calculate each paper’s quality\r\nindex.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gOjvGRLcaeMxIcBzvOibExPo+Fg7ViC9D3k8rKB1LlQ="},"e7353cae-9b91-4763-a2de-f1c0e5ae199e":{"id_":"e7353cae-9b91-4763-a2de-f1c0e5ae199e","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"NcBznpLOL/sV7VL+ONtOprYEBOP6L0lt9Cal8R/yNpg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e4149d00-b9d6-459e-976c-3f68c5d243cf","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"gOjvGRLcaeMxIcBzvOibExPo+Fg7ViC9D3k8rKB1LlQ="}},"text":"Given that there are 12 items on our Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC)\r\nshown inTable 3, each paper could obtain a score between 0 and 12.

A large\r\nvolume of alerts means analysts often struggle tofind true attacks among\r\nthe mist of many alerts. Onwubiko [6], points out that not all alerts lead to\r\nan incident as there are false incidents (false positives). Incidents are\r\nevents or alerts that pose a threat [36]. Limiting log collection to impor-\r\ntant assets/devices, policy tuning andfiltering out unnecessary alerts\r\n(noise) have been suggested by some writers/researchers as some of\r\nthe techniques that can be used to address these challenges [6]. Despite these recommendations, the evidence from the literature sug-\r\ngests that analysts continue to struggle when it comes to the volume of\r\nalerts they process [37]. ●False Positives (FPs)–FPs are reported by several authors as one of the\r\nmany challenges’analysts have to deal with (P1, P5, P6, P8, P10, P11 and\r\nP13). FP represents the number of‘false alarms’presented to the analysts\r\n[3,44]. These alarms are not true attacks (true positives) but are falsely\r\npresented to the analyst as though they are, causing them to initiate some\r\nform of investigation thereby wasting analyst time. 47% of the selected\r\npapers discuss the challenge posed by FPs and highlight that FPs contri-\r\nbute to the high number of alerts presented to the analysts. Like the\r\nvolume of alerts, FP’s are also the result of collecting too many logs. Lif\r\nand Sommestad [4], warn that too many FPs can result in an IDS operator\r\ncompletely ignoring alerts. Factors such as misconfiguration of systems\r\nand weak signature/detection strings designed by the vendor or the ana-\r\nlysts that incorrectly matches legitimate network traffic. Recommendation\r\nfor reducing FP include tuning policies and machine learning [38]. Businesses can also put in more efforts into addressing misconfiguration\r\nissues to reduce the burden on analysts.

Along with this,\r\nanalysts are also under time pressure during incident handling [15]. Identifying an attack is one thing; handling the attack through the incident\r\nhandling process is another [36]. Both P4 and P10 suggest that detecting\r\nand managing security incidents (attack) is crucial for the success of a SOC. Incident management typically involves engaging with (or escalations to)\r\nother teams, internal or external to the organisation, to ensure that the\r\nimpact of any attack is minimised or removed [41]. The complexity of\r\nincident handling can be daunting for less experienced analysts which\r\nmeans they rely on the guidance of experienced analysts. With studies\r\nsuggesting SOCs struggling to retain experienced analysts, handling com-\r\nplex incidents becomes a challenge [10]. ●Skills/Experience Shortage–(P3, P4, P5, P12 and P15) highlight skills and\r\nexperience shortages are among the challenges facing the analysts. The\r\nrapid turnover of analysts means SOCs struggle to retain their most experi-\r\nenced and qualified analysts [1]. This creates a challenge for less experi-\r\nenced analysts as the opportunity to learn from experienced analysts\r\nbecomes an issue. The dynamic nature of cyber threats means that unless\r\nanalysts receive periodic training, either in-house or off-site paid training,\r\nthey are unlikely to possess that skills required to beat offan attacker [7]. ●Inadequate  Communication  between  Teams–P1 reports inadequate\r\ncommunicate between analysts as one of the challenges in SOCs [5]. Hámornik & Krasznay [15],explains that communication and information\r\nsharing is vital to the success of a SOC although they argue that team\r\nmembers generally do not have time to communicate when they are under\r\npressure. The lack of effective communication between the team impact on\r\nthe team’s performance [15]. Sundaramurthy et al. [7], state that SOCs must\r\nwork towards addressing the lack of communication so that analysts do not\r\nfeel left behind or isolated. ●Tacit  Knowledge–The problem with tacit knowledge is that it is not\r\nlimited to SOC environment as many professions also have a similar issue\r\n[42].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xR1hdBC9WX/fRL9vmcbFZ9ZC90k5V5POTD+1CUEjktw="},"28a4c8e8-391c-4003-bf51-8615041d792a":{"id_":"28a4c8e8-391c-4003-bf51-8615041d792a","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"dHI8JKEK+0F566rEqCayfoiPiuhkhkAgDZm+2/fnGow="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f435c029-739c-4f7b-83a7-0f1cac63ef86","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"xR1hdBC9WX/fRL9vmcbFZ9ZC90k5V5POTD+1CUEjktw="}},"text":"However, within a SOC environment, P2 and P11 highlight that tacit\r\nknowledge can hinder or slow down the investigation in the SOC.

One approach to addressing this may be for\r\nSOCs to have playbooks or run books along with well-documented pro-\r\ncesses that less experienced can draw on to aid decision making in SOCs.

The use of SIEM (Security Information and\r\nEvent Management) technologies along with security event visualisation\r\nsystems can ease offsome of the burden associated with manual and\r\nrepetitive processes [1,2]. ●Workloads–Sundaramurthy and his colleagues [43],argue that analysts\r\nare confronted with more alerts than they can investigate. This view is\r\nsupported by Feng et al. [38], who suggest that increased workload is\r\nmainly due to the overwhelming number of alerts analysts have to process. P3, P6, P7, P10, P9, P13, P14 and P15 all identify workload as a major\r\nchallenge faced by analysts. Previous studies suggest that increased work-\r\nload also makes it difficult for analysts to maintain situational awareness,\r\nvigilance and attention [4]. Lif and Sommestad [4],posit that workload\r\nimpacts on analysts monitoring, analysis and response capabilities. They\r\nfurther argue that attention has an impact on operators (analysts) response\r\ntime and so are eye movement when it comes to vigilance. These human\r\nfactors that lead to poor performances are often less investigated or even\r\nmeasured to see how performance can be tracked and improved. ●Analyst Burnout–P2 and P3 identify burnout as a major challenge facing\r\nSOC analysts. Burnout phenomenon is an active area of research for many\r\nresearchers [7,14]. The consensus amongst researchers is that burnout is\r\nthe result of multiple organizational, environmental and human factors\r\nsuch as alert fatigue, stress, workload and anxiety which in turn lead to\r\nturnover among analysts [15,44]. ●Assessment Methods for Analysts–SOC managers, usually expect good\r\noperational performance from their analysts as noted by P1 and P2 [5,7]. However, studies suggest a lack of adequate metrics and measures for\r\nassessing the performance of analysts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2IIcQs7VqrSrbVhO/hnR9dtYwkCvfag+MVHmZXDw3Yo="},"a08238fb-c5ff-42d6-bbd9-5a22aa2a213f":{"id_":"a08238fb-c5ff-42d6-bbd9-5a22aa2a213f","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_15","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"vasxKgk4KpBFHopXk0s4caxOHIcD0JJaFGKRL0Oj1tI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"71cdd83e-ad0e-43f1-847a-c95683fb6d9b","metadata":{"page_number":15,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"2IIcQs7VqrSrbVhO/hnR9dtYwkCvfag+MVHmZXDw3Yo="}},"text":"The problem here is that in some\r\ncases, analysts and managers do not agree on how performance needs to\r\nbe measured, and managers have difficulty in devising good metrics.

Our focus is on the analyst performance metric, i.e. metric that measures how well the analyst performs. We noted that there are\r\nlimited metrics for measuring analyst performance and this has been attributed\r\nto the difficulty in devising a useful metric, as managers do not even know what\r\nthe right metric should be [7]. Ten of the selected papers (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7, P9,\r\nP11, P12, P13, P14) identify and reports on various metrics that are frequently\r\nused to measure analysts performance. As pointed out earlier, authors do not always make the distinction between\r\nmetrics and measures and use the terms interchangeably. To that end, we\r\ngrouped existing assessment methods into quantitative and qualitative metrics/\r\nmeasures. The quantitative metrics/measures are less open to interpretation and\r\nprovide concrete measures, unlike the qualitative metricsthat usesnon-numerical\r\nand interpretive approach. The quantitative metrics identified are:\r\n●Time to Detect an Incident (TTD) or Average Time to Detect (ATTD)–\r\nThis metric focuses on the delta (time) between an issue occurring and the\r\nanalyst noticing it as identified in P1 and P11. It takes into consideration the\r\ntime an alert is detected by a detection tool, such as an Intrusion Detection\r\nSystem (IDS) or a SIEM, and the time that the analyst discovers it. ●Average  Time  Taken  to  Respond  (ATTR)–ATTR focuses on the time\r\ntaken by an analyst to respond to an incident as reported in P12 and P14. Unlike ATTD, ATTR assesses response time rather than detection time. Responding may entail specific action such as reconfiguring a network to\r\nstop any threat. Some authors refer to this as the Average Total Time for\r\nAlert (avgTTA) Investigation [47]. Others refer to this as the time taken to\r\ninvestigate a customer under attack [39]. The time-based metrics focus on\r\nanalysts reaction times, in terms of how quick they respond or detect an\r\nincident. ●Number of Alerts Analysed/Unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\r\na shift–This measure, focuses on counting the number of alerts processed\r\nby the analysts as identified in P6 and P14.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lCsO4T1XzGOyvsYI2LYusqQut8fsSFUFwbjIL5QdjBU="},"d342ca54-47db-4cc4-82ea-92f932f5a514":{"id_":"d342ca54-47db-4cc4-82ea-92f932f5a514","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"LuRS3XNZHP2zeTvaOx1GbP60uRNEXzBq34M4BD+KSDY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"df4b8624-b065-41a9-b0cb-f98bf75fb6ed","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"lCsO4T1XzGOyvsYI2LYusqQut8fsSFUFwbjIL5QdjBU="}},"text":"These metrics do not take into\r\nconsideration the complexity of the alert [43]. ●The number of tickets closed per day–This metric merely counts the\r\nnumber of tickets closed by the analyst at the end of the day (P7, P9).

Indeed, all the metrics showed inFigure 4can\r\nbe used to evaluate how well the analysts are performing, albeit they are dis-\r\njointed and unless a SOC implements multiple metrics, it will be hard to get\r\na holistic view of analysts’effort. Notwithstanding, measuring human factors such\r\nas analystssituational awareness,vigilanceand attentionare also important to get\r\na holistic view of analysts performance [4]. Discussion\r\nAlthough SOCs have been an active research area, the challenges faced by\r\nanalysts and performance metrics for analysts are usually mentioned by\r\nresearchers in passing and are rarely the main focus. This is discouraging\r\nbecause challenges faced by analysts impacts on the performance of the SOC\r\n[44]. Identification of specific challenges faced by analysts will provide SOC\r\nexperts with an opportunity to learn and facilitate the development of novel\r\napproaches to helping analysts address these challenges. Likewise, measuring\r\nthe performance of an analyst is important because anything that is not mea-\r\nsured cannot be managed [9]. From a practical perspective, an objective per-\r\nformance metric can be used by the analyst for self-assessment to establish how\r\nwell they are contributing to the team’s objective. SOC managers can also use\r\nobjective performance metrics to evaluate analysts’performance and to moti-\r\nvate them [7]. Many of the challenges faced by the analyst pointed out in the papers\r\nreviewed, play into the hands of an attacker. For example, over 40% of the\r\npapers reviewed reported the volume of alerts received by an analyst as\r\na critical issue. Although collecting system events logs can provide valuable\r\ninformation about an attacker’s activities, in practice large volume of alerts also\r\nmeans that the analysts have to go through thousands of alerts to detect\r\na single true attack if any [7]. Attackers can easily blend in among the mist of\r\nseveral logs. Recommendations such as collecting essential logs, designing\r\nuseful use cases (UC’s) and using pre-defined correlation rules in SIEM solutions,\r\ndo not seem to address this challenge [50,44]. While it is acknowledged that\r\nanalysts cannot possibly investigate all alerts and that some level of automation\r\nis required, tuning policies can help analysts to manage alert volumes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"neZCIawCQEsHJNx3LNMy5ixv/QvBxbbWTWZzkUVSyzw="},"4d4eb5d3-1959-4ed4-ae8b-846a7137dea6":{"id_":"4d4eb5d3-1959-4ed4-ae8b-846a7137dea6","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_20","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"b0udZcZPD5+CGZck+wxX1fzVfdHTJ71i0fEY/gZKdoc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dcdeb25a-9ee0-45f1-83f9-32c9342befbb","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"neZCIawCQEsHJNx3LNMy5ixv/QvBxbbWTWZzkUVSyzw="}},"text":"Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, analysts coping strategies when it\r\ncomes to managing a large volume of alerts have not been studied or addressed\r\nbefore in literature.

However,\r\npolicy tuning andfiltering to reduce FPs is a time-consuming activity [15]. Notwithstanding, unless analysts are measured on the number of FP tickets\r\nraised, managers will not know those that need training. Future metrics, there-\r\nfore, must take this into consideration. Another area of concern is analyst burnout, which research shows lead to\r\nhigh analyst turnover. According to Sundaramurthy et al. [7,12], negative factors\r\nsuch as low skills, the lack of empowerment, low growth and low creativity in\r\nSOCs lead to analyst burnout. They propose a model to explain the burned-out\r\nphenomena among analysts. However, the completeness of the model was not\r\nadequately verified due to the lack of analysts to participate in the study. Besides, evidence from current literature shows that there are other challenges\r\nfaced by analysts that were not captured in their work. For example, dealing\r\nwith sophisticated attacks and false positives [52]. Notwithstanding, none of the\r\npapers reviewed provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by\r\nthe analyst. We argue that further research is needed tofill this gap and to\r\nvalidate prior work. The paper at hand is a stepping stone towards this goal. When it comes to measuring analyst performance, our review suggests that\r\nvarious metrics exist for doing this; however, some authors argue about their\r\ncompleteness and objectivity and make a case for the need for further research in\r\nthis area [5].

The frequency\r\nin this situation refers to how often the data is collected or reported [53]. Responsibilities of analysts are well documented by various studies [1,6,54]. For\r\nexample, analysts are expected to create Use Cases (UC’s) to detect attacks or\r\nmodify UC’s, yet in the examined literature we did not come across an objective\r\nmetric that takes use case creation into consideration [6].

However, these metrics\r\nalso have their limitations. For instance, metrics that count the number of\r\nsecurity incidents raised or closed by an analyst do not take into consideration\r\nthe complexity or priority of the incident [43]. In fact, such a metric does not\r\nprovide enough information to differentiate two or more analysts raising the\r\nsame number of incidents, assuming one is raising critical incidents, and another\r\nis raising false positives or lower priority alerts. Sundaramurthy et al. [5],stress\r\nthat priority should be given to alerts that pose a direct threat. A metric that\r\nmerely counts the number of incidents raised by analysts as shown inFigure 4\r\nmay suggest that the analysts are on par. However, in reality, some analysts may\r\nchoose to raise or close a high quantity of easy tickets to look good on such\r\na metric [43]. Shah et al. [39],suggest that alerts processed by analysts are usually\r\nclassified as low, medium and high severity. It would make sense for\r\na performance metric to take into account the priority or severity of the incident\r\nraised rather than treating all incident as the same. We are not advocating for\r\nfocusing solely on high priority events/alerts and suppressing everything else. But rather, we argue that a good metric should have features that make such\r\ndistinctions; taking into consideration multiple factors to help SOC managers\r\nand analysts to get a holistic view. It is clear from our review that, there is a need for improvement of existing\r\nanalyst’s performance metrics. In-fact existing metrics are not sustainable because\r\nof the frustration and dissatisfaction it causes among analysts [7,43]. Although\r\nresearchers have used ethnographic methods, case studies, grounded theory and\r\nanthropology to study analysts, these methodologies do not necessarily seek to\r\ndevise strategies to address analysts problems and challenges [20,55]. An alternative methodology such as design science can be used alongside\r\ncase study to facilitate the design or improvement of existing analyst metrics. However, given that a SOC is unique to its organisation [1], research is needed to\r\nascertain the feasibility of designing a universal set of metrics that can be used\r\nby analysts working in different SOCs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SGqXeOuessjiQmCfQZLgjjBa768cOJ34lkg/HKOQRlU="},"c225426c-39c6-4d42-97d2-5e35cb45c4d8":{"id_":"c225426c-39c6-4d42-97d2-5e35cb45c4d8","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_22","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"4nNMMfxwink/hdzb8jQG5sTVExeLkfAI2xKdBj6e2NE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cbee7f50-549d-4767-82f7-50ce0bdd2dd7","metadata":{"page_number":22,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"SGqXeOuessjiQmCfQZLgjjBa768cOJ34lkg/HKOQRlU="}},"text":"Indeed, the role of analysts can be broad\r\nand varied making it difficult to measure every aspect [10].

The SLR also investigate\r\nthe mapping between the challenges faced by analysts and coverage provided\r\nby existing analysts performance metrics. One hundred and twenty-one (121)\r\npapers were initially selected as part of our SLR process; however, only 15\r\nstudies were included, based on our review protocol and criteria. In this study, we identified twelve (12) challenges faced by analysts and\r\nreport them as: the volume of alerts presented to the analyst; the number of\r\nfalse positive alerts; false negatives; sophisticated attacks; incident handling/\r\nincident management complexity; skills/experience shortage; inadequate com-\r\nmunication between teams; tacit knowledge; manual and repetitive processes;\r\nworkloads; analysts burnout and the lack of adequate metrics and measures for\r\nassessing the efforts of analysts. We also identified the following metrics and\r\nmeasures for assessing the performance of analysts: time to detect an incident/\r\naverage time to detect an incident, average time taken to respond to an\r\nincident, number of alerts analysed/unanalysed by an analyst at the end of\r\na shift, the number of tickets closed per day, the number of incidents detected\r\nwithin a specific timeframe, time spent on operations by the analyst, time spent\r\non each ticket, a measure of the competency and experience of the analysts,\r\nsuccess stories, the quality of incident reports and the quality of analysis. Ourfindings suggest that there are several areas of an analyst’s work that can\r\nbe measured to give a comprehensive picture of the work of an analyst. Our\r\nmapping of the challenges faced by analysts and the coverage provided by\r\nexisting metrics also revealed that there are some challenges with no associated\r\nmetrics, for example, the burnout phenomenon. Such a metric will be useful for\r\nSOC managers who may want to measure burnout amongst analysts. This paper consolidates and synthesizes existing knowledge on the chal-\r\nlenges faced by analysts along with existing metrics for measuring analysts\r\nperformance. A key lesson learnt is that effort to investigate and understand\r\nintervention strategies to address the challenges faced by the analysts are\r\nlacking. Furthermore, this study has revealed that analysts’performance is not\r\nnecessarily measured based on their efforts in addressing the challenges they\r\nface.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4LATjihAdEnZD/40fmkMO0Ct6CSqSlyCkLntuZaJMeo="},"bd3cc52d-d510-4832-8bfd-baa1a11658a5":{"id_":"bd3cc52d-d510-4832-8bfd-baa1a11658a5","metadata":{"page_number":23,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf_23","metadata":{"page_number":23,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"VQB0yrpREtIxhyNuR9SAzmciDkg5w/AlaslctcvGy6M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"00b14b49-f47d-48cc-a0cb-35cbcc30315b","metadata":{"page_number":23,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf","file_name":"Challenges and performance metrics for security operations center analysts  a systematic review.pdf"},"hash":"4LATjihAdEnZD/40fmkMO0Ct6CSqSlyCkLntuZaJMeo="}},"text":"Rather analysts’performance metrics are based on effort in achieving their\r\ntasks/functions amid the challenges they face.

The\r\nlack of structure and clear objectives to T1 analyses makes\r\noperative inefficiencies hard to spot, SOC performance hard\r\nto measure (and therefore improve), results in overall lower\r\nsecurity for the monitored environment(s), and contributes to\r\nanalyst burnout. In this work we collaborate with a commer-\r\ncial SOC to devise a 4-stage (network) threat analysis process\r\nto support the collection and analysis of relevant information\r\nfor threat analysis. We conduct an experiment with ten T1 an-\r\nalysts employed in the SOC and show that analysts following\r\nthe proposed process are 2.5 times more likely to produce an\r\naccurate assessment than analysts who do not. We evaluate\r\nqualitatively the effects of the process on analysts decisions,\r\nand discuss implications for practice and research. 1  Introduction\r\nAs the volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase,\r\nthe security of networks and systems is of key societal and\r\neconomic importance.Security Operation Centers(SOCs)\r\nare business units (within a larger organizational setting), or\r\nservices (that typically sell managed security services such\r\nas security monitoring to third party organizations) whose\r\npurpose is to detect cyber-attacks within the monitored envi-\r\nronments.

August 6–8, 2023, Anaheim, CA, USA\r\nsystem of analysts whereby incoming security events in the\r\nform of alerts are first analyzed by tier 1 (T1) analysts, who\r\nare typically junior and relatively inexperienced [20] and only\r\nescalated to higher tiers (typically through T2 and up to T3\r\nanalysts) when the T1 believes the event to be a potential\r\nthreat to an organization [14]. This tiered system generates\r\na procedure whereby T1 analysts analyze plentiful of false\r\npositive alerts (i.e., that are ‘not interesting’ for escalation) [2]\r\nand pass on relevant information to higher tiers for more in-\r\ndepth investigation on alerts for which T1s cannot rule out\r\nevidence of attack [14]. Thus, the timeliness, accuracy, and relevancy of the infor-\r\nmation T1 analysts pass on to T2/T3 analysts is crucial to\r\neffective and efficient SOC operations, and by extension to the\r\nsecurity of the monitored environments. Despite this, in many\r\nSOCs, the actions that SOC analysts take and the information\r\nthey seek to inform their decisions depends mainly on tacit\r\nknowledge and their own background [5,23], as opposed to\r\na clear structure or framework to identify relevant evidence\r\nleading to well-informed decisions. T1 analysts typically do\r\nreceive training, but generally in the form of internal proce-\r\ndures, systems, and new vulnerabilities [22], rather than in\r\nthe form of an evidence-based decision-making process for\r\neffective threat analysis. This can lead to large differences in\r\naccuracy across T1 analysts [26,28].

SOCs can be internal, where they pro-\r\nvide security services to their own (often large) organization,\r\nor external by providing security services to third parties. The\r\nsecurity services provided by SOCs can range from network\r\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS), to endpoint detection\r\nand firewall monitoring. The tools providing these services\r\nmay utilize static detection mechanisms, dynamic systems,\r\nmachine learning, artificial intelligence and more. However,\r\n1https://www.eindhovensecurityhub.nl/\r\nmost of these technical security solutions in an operational\r\nSOC generate security events which are in the first instance\r\nevaluated by a T1 analyst in the SOC. The analysis performed\r\nby T1 analysts aims to discern interesting security events\r\nfrom not interesting events. In other words, identify ‘interest-\r\ning’ security events to escalate to T2 and T3 security analysts\r\nfor further investigation, communication to customers and\r\npossible mitigation actions. Since T1 analysts are the first to analyze and classify se-\r\ncurity events, the accuracy and timeliness of their analysis is\r\nfundamental to a SOC. Indeed, an accurate and timely identi-\r\nfication of a cyber-attack minimizes the time available for the\r\nattack to complete [8], or may prevent its impact to be fully re-\r\nalized. Unfortunately,investigations performed by T1 analysts\r\nare known to be, in general, error prone and time-consuming,\r\ndespite being repetitive [10,12,22,31]. Naturally, the quality\r\nof the analysis and thus the accuracy of the classification is\r\ndependent on the individual skill of the analyst. However, ex-\r\nternal factors can impact this significantly, such as the arrival\r\nof external vulnerability information, or the addition of a new\r\nnetwork segment in scope of an analyst’s monitoring. Given\r\nthat this occurs regularly, yet not necessarily predictably, the\r\nquality of security event analyses can be quite variable [26]. 2.2  The security analysis process\r\nThe analysis process of a T1 analyst has as input a security\r\nevent, and as output a classification of this security event.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+3wNz7suo0ykrhGgck9w5Kzp4mAYXwmcOANX2bTKAok="},"691c126d-e341-4ed7-baf3-ff0a969b6d78":{"id_":"691c126d-e341-4ed7-baf3-ff0a969b6d78","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"IbwcXSHNaQ9GQ0jKA/OY6zFtldmam1AGDUv8+6rXrxs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eb62a91b-3eb0-4ef2-a6bb-b6f5103d1bdd","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"+3wNz7suo0ykrhGgck9w5Kzp4mAYXwmcOANX2bTKAok="}},"text":"Regardless of internal taxonomies, analysts can in general\r\nassign a security event to one of two groups: alerts worthy\r\nof escalation to a higher tier for further investigation (further\r\nreferred to as ‘interesting’ alerts), and those who should not be\r\nescalated (further referred to as ‘not interesting’ alerts) [10].2\r\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the analyst’s job is to look for\r\nevidence relating to the security event under analysis with\r\nother (security or network) events from any available and\r\nrelevant source, with the goal of performing a triage for a\r\npossible escalation to higher tiers [6,19,29].

Interestingly, the authors highlight the obser-\r\nvation that analysts employ different strategies and processes\r\nto explore the data and generate hypotheses to investigate. In\r\nlater work Zhong et al. [30] propose a tool that automates\r\nthe data triage aspect of aT1 analyst’s work. They observed\r\nhigh-performance and satisfactory false-positive rates. They\r\ndo note, however, that the quality of the system depends on\r\nthe quality of the triage traces, which in turn depends on the\r\nquality of the analyst. Notably, this approach utilizes the op-\r\nerations of the analysts, such as “searching”,“selecting” and\r\n“filtering” [30], and does not capture why an analyst performs\r\nthis action, nor what evidence is obtained from this operation.

Often, the security analysts cannot clearly\r\ncommunicate their knowledge related to the incident and the\r\nreason for their classification of this incident [23].

RQ1. To derive the threat analysis process we worked closely\r\nwith a T2 security analysis expert with 4+ years of experience\r\nwho is currently active in the SOC to identify which infor-\r\nmation a T1 analyst should consider for the ‘escalation’ of\r\nthe alert to be useful for the higher-tier analysts. The derived\r\ninformation was then mapped to the categories presented in\r\nTable1and used to build a step-wise process for the analysis. This process was then iteratively and independently evalu-\r\nated by two senior analysts (with respectively 15+ and 10+\r\nyears of experience) active in the SOC, until all three experts\r\nwere in agreement on the resulting threat analysis process. Implementation details and results are given in Section5. RQ2. To validate the identified threat analysis process we\r\ndesigned an experiment to compare the performance of SOC\r\nanalysts who employ the process to conduct analysis of alert\r\ndata in the SOC, against that of analysts who do not. We\r\nemploy sensor data from one of the organizations monitored\r\nby the SOC to sample alerts from a real-life environment. This\r\nensures that baseline information (such as the IP space of that\r\norganization) is already known to the analysts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"DZ+87ZDLP91gAXFwuX4LCbek5wrxWt78UyY0PEbHJRk="},"e50e85b8-89cf-4728-a656-50d7db8134af":{"id_":"e50e85b8-89cf-4728-a656-50d7db8134af","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"Fz2DN7bawxrs7QuCAOH3oKGmPtJQ4xjoKfvEecpghaQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ff1ac732-0b3e-4f70-a802-2799f6d170c7","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"DZ+87ZDLP91gAXFwuX4LCbek5wrxWt78UyY0PEbHJRk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9560088a-1c68-4733-8de4-13dd78cd960c","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"Q3aTwgNQ70B6Sdecjuo8DUmeJE8j7hg2evNDxC75gy0="}},"text":"In addition to\r\nusing alerts from our sensor, we generated additional alerts by\r\ninjecting attacks into the virtual SOC environment to validate\r\nour process on alerts relating to successful attacks.

The second stage consists of two steps; alert history (AH) and\r\nsurrounding alerts (SA). Alert history.The analyst investigates the history of the\r\nalert under investigation. Namely, how often the alert has been\r\ntriggered in the past, how often it was considered interesting,\r\nand whether it triggered for the same internal host before. Using this information, an analyst can verify quickly whether\r\nthe observed alert is a common false positive or not. If past\r\noccurrences have been flagged as ‘not interesting’ due to them\r\nbeing false positives, the analyst can consider that the alert\r\nunder investigation may be a false positive as well. Surrounding alerts.The analyst investigates additional\r\nalerts similar to the one under investigation that were triggered\r\nby one or multiple of the involved hosts, around the time of\r\nthe potential attack. When looking at these surrounding alerts,\r\nanalysts may observe different alerts with similar names, indi-\r\ncating the same potential attack.

This selection is largely dependent on the type of\r\nalert, and the type of traffic it is triggered on. In general,RL\r\nconsists of at least a connection log, a protocol specific log\r\n(such as HTTP, or SSH), in addition to the alert log. Further-\r\nmore, any other logs generated by the receiving host of the\r\nprotocol in the alert, or DNS logs, are typically related. Traffic stream information.The analyst considers more\r\ndetailed information about the packets sent to and from the\r\nhost. This information can include the total number of bytes\r\nand packets sent by the attacker and defender, and the data\r\ncontained in those packets. The protocol used between the\r\ncommunication of the attacker and defender is an important\r\nconsideration in this step as it determines whether the number\r\nof packets and the data contained in them are abnormal or not\r\nin the specific context. For example, this step allows analysts\r\nto identify successful port scans by verifying if a response\r\npacket was sent back to the source. This also allows analysts\r\nto determine whether any ‘lucky hits’, were generated. A\r\n‘lucky hit’ occurs when the trigger conditions of a signature\r\n(typically a non-specific one, as assessed in theSiSstep) are\r\nmet by pure chance on a random sequence of bytes, and thus\r\ntrigger on benign traffic, producing false-positives.

This step can vary\r\ngreatly from SOC to SOC and even from monitored environ-\r\nment to monitored environment, as corporate policies differ\r\nbetween organizations. Target host behaviour.Next to utilizing known informa-\r\ntion about the targeted host, the analyst reviews the current\r\nbehaviorof the targeted host. For this,the logs produced by the\r\nIDS and network sniffer are utilized to review the behaviour\r\nof the host before and after the attack.

Attack/Exploit information.In this step, the analyst de-\r\ntermines the exact attack and tools involved. The information\r\nrequired to determine this originates from the signature which\r\ntriggered the alert, and open source information about the cor-\r\nresponding attack. From this step, it should be clear whether\r\nthere is an attack, and if so what attack specifically. Using\r\nthis information, in relation to that collected in the previous\r\nsteps (e.g.RL,THI) the analyst estimates how this specific\r\nattack can have impact on the customer. Attacker information.The analyst investigates the be-\r\nhaviour of the attacker (or at least of the attacking system). Using the logs generated as a result of the attacker behaviour,\r\nas well as using public sources, the analyst can determine\r\nwhether the attacker is an actual attacker. This step is needed\r\nto rule out known and trusted sources such as (vulnerabil-\r\nity) scanners, as well as help identifying false positive alerts\r\ngenerating ‘hits’ on backup streams, software updates, and\r\nbenign network downloads. Attack success indicators.The analyst investigates\r\nwhether the attack was successful. Analysts use information\r\nobtained from former stages and open sources that identify\r\nclear indicators of successful attacks. Generally, the attack\r\nsuccess indicators are highly dependent on the specific attack,\r\nhowever, generic indicators such as DNS requests for unusual\r\ntop-level domains or internal scanning can be used as well. Relation to use cases.The analyst consults the use cases\r\nfor the affected environment. This step helps them to correctly\r\nidentify the full impact for the environment, and thus the\r\nfinal classification of the alert.

For example, aCnCalert (ThreatFox\r\nBazarBackdoor botnet C2 traffic, whose instance in\r\nour data is classified as ‘interesting’ by the T2 analyst) in\r\nscenario no. 3 was erroneously classified by an analyst as ‘not\r\ninteresting’ as the network communication related to this alert\r\n“only” contained 10 packets. One of the analysts remarks:“Its\r\n[the count is] below 50. So, this alert can also be dismissed. ”\r\nWhereas ‘50’ is not a limit specified anywhere in the SOC\r\nfor this type of alert, we later learned that this cut-off number\r\nis considered relevant for SSH brute force attacks. This sug-\r\ngests that the analyst erroneously considered this a universal\r\nthreshold when deciding whether a communication is large\r\nenough to be considered potentially interesting, despite the\r\nalert in question being completely unrelated to SSH brute\r\nforcing.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"d77J+aYmI6BQUoJWnZy4ulqweldNumPpwAl67DK0uYE="},"f6029474-ec0b-48ef-b6c7-6ad10dc690ac":{"id_":"f6029474-ec0b-48ef-b6c7-6ad10dc690ac","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"+Fbmy2F9N380Z2MveWfnJosaBjC5AdG/W6EyWsv+FIk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7925555f-7c70-4681-9d83-a7c6b500837b","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"d77J+aYmI6BQUoJWnZy4ulqweldNumPpwAl67DK0uYE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a3ab235d-d0e8-436d-b847-66122c826ba1","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf","file_name":"Give Me Structure - Synthesis and Evaluation of a (Network) Threat Analysis Process Supporting Tier 1 Investigations in a Security Operation Center.pdf"},"hash":"OXqDfQzwu1GXQXAIWRtt/Z+CMl1qVzFh4gTJD7NV2+o="}},"text":"This seems in line with the generally accepted notion\r\nof ‘implicit knowledge’ being employed by analysts [5,22].

In  another  investigation  on  alertET JA3 Hash -\r\n[Abuse.ch] Possible Dridex, two analysts who erro-\r\nneously classified it as ‘not interesting’ had previously\r\nobserved high false positive rates with alerts associated to\r\n‘JA3’ hashes. Therefore, analysts investigating JA3 alerts\r\noften mumbled that this is most likely going to be a false\r\npositive. Further, this alert was associated to a limited (9)\r\nnumber of packets, leading analysts not following the process\r\nto classify it as ‘not interesting’ despite the presence of\r\nconcrete evidence of a connection from a suspicious IP\r\nbeing established with the host. By contrast, analysts in\r\nthe treatment group identified that this alert was related\r\nto another ‘interesting’ alert at theSAstep. Whereas the\r\nT1 analysts could not observe much of the data relating to\r\nthe network communication of this alert, they identified\r\nsufficient evidence to escalate it, considering that if the alert\r\nwas related to an attack it would have a high impact to the\r\norganization. One of the analysts following our process\r\nremarked the following related to this alert: “Could not tell\r\nthat the decoded message would have had a relation to this\r\ntraffic. It is still malware-related, making it more significant\r\nfor the customer and this same IP was also involved with\r\nthe Threatfox backdoor alert. ” Interestingly, another analyst\r\nfollowing the process and correctly classifying this alert as\r\n‘interesting’ commented “It’s weird.

For example, ‘not interesting’\r\nalerts raised by attempted (but failed) port scans can often\r\nbe dismissed by simply observing that the host system did\r\nnot communicate back to the attacker. Therefore, most ana-\r\nlysts would classify such alerts correctly, regardless of how\r\nrigorously they analyse the evidence. By contrast, T1 analysts\r\nin our experiment struggled more with analysing ‘interest-\r\ning’ alerts correctly. This is unsurprising as these alerts are\r\nin general more complex and require the analysis of more\r\ninformation. Considering a delta of 20% in correct assess-\r\nments for ‘interesting’ alerts between the two experimental\r\nconditions, our results suggest that structuring the analysis\r\nprocess may improve the classification accuracy specifically\r\nfor the hardest alerts to analyze. Our example in Section6.1\r\nillustrates that this may be the case as analysts who do not\r\nfollow our process may over-rely on one information point\r\nand simultaneously not consider other relevant information\r\nrequired for the analysis, whereas analysts who do eventually\r\nfind the relevant information. 7.1  Implications for practice\r\nTraining.SOCs conduct training for their T1 analysts to for\r\nexample, update analysts on the latest threats and how to\r\nanalyze them [8,11,14]. As the training directly improves the\r\neffectiveness of analysts, it is considered a crucial aspect of a\r\nSOC [2,11,20]. However, T1 analysts need to have a baseline\r\nlevel in their work, such that analysts are able to perform\r\nadequately even if they have not been trained on that specific\r\nset of alerts. By structuring the workflow of a T1 analyst, it\r\nstreamlines the baseline knowledge a T1 analyst should have\r\nin a SOC. The specific information T1 analysts should collect\r\nis explicitly defined, and thus SOCs can tailor their training\r\ntowards how to collect the required information.

Our proposed\r\nthreat analysis process can standardize the workflow of T1 an-\r\nalysts in terms of what information they should collect during\r\ntheir analyses.

Importantly, this may reveal ‘weak’ spots in the detection\r\nand escalation processes in place at a SOC, giving managers\r\naccurate metrics on which to base future adjustments. Escalation.When an alert is being escalated by a T1 analyst,\r\nthe analyst escalates the alert itself with supporting evidence\r\nwhy the alert has been escalated [13].

Furthermore, by removing uncertainty on the expec-\r\ntations of a T2 analyst on what information they will receive\r\nfrom a T1 analyst, the time needed to interpret each ticket by\r\na T2 analyst may be reduced. 7.2Implications for research and future work\r\nThere have been numerous previous studies presenting pro-\r\nposed tools pertaining to issues in the threat analysis process\r\nof SOC analysts [3,4,9,31].

Our threat\r\nanalysis process consists of four stages where it guides the\r\nanalyst into collecting information relevant for their analysis. Furthermore, we conducted an experiment using real alert\r\ndata with ten T1 analysts working in a commercial SOC to\r\ninvestigate the effect of structuring the threat analysis pro-\r\ncess. Our results show that our process increases the odds\r\nof our subjects correctly classifying an alert by 167%. More\r\nspecifically, we observed that alerts correlated with a cyber\r\nattack are the alerts who significantly benefit from using our\r\nthreat analysis process. Overall, our study suggests that struc-\r\nturing the analysis process of a T1 analyst aid in the correct\r\nclassification of security alerts.

For this \r\ntype  of  node,  the  system  requirements  are  minimal: 1 \r\nGB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 100 GB and 1 NIC. An   example   of   the   standard   distributed   architecture, \r\npresented  in  Fig. 1,  contains  the  manager  node,  two  search \r\nnodes and two forward nodes. Security      Onion's      distributed      architecture      allows \r\norganizations    to    adapt    to    various    environments    and \r\nrequirements,  providing  a  scalable  and  powerful  solution  for \r\nmonitoring, analyzing and managing network and host security \r\n[6]. In the Security Onion platform, the data flow refers to the \r\nprocess  of  importing,  transferring  or  collecting  data  from \r\nvarious sources and entering it into a system or database to be \r\nprocessed,  analyzed  and  stored. The  data  flow  may  include \r\nimporting raw data, transforming and processing it to match the \r\nstructure of the target system, and ensuring data quality before \r\nstorage. In  the  Security  Onion  platform,  the  data  flow  is  a \r\nprocess that takes place in several stages:  \r\na) Data collection \r\nb) Data processing and storage  \r\nc) Data analysis and visualization.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"N5+6eUFKKGqsrIpQzRD802IH8y0c9LrzroNCfY/u4OA="},"3e4f7e1b-c7c0-46a9-9db6-719f6db1937e":{"id_":"3e4f7e1b-c7c0-46a9-9db6-719f6db1937e","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf_4","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"jClfS28uzeTOgl9BnXA92b3es0I6k3pJQVJnG4QoRbk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"16702f01-f152-4170-bff8-0d76d0870a40","metadata":{"page_number":4,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"N5+6eUFKKGqsrIpQzRD802IH8y0c9LrzroNCfY/u4OA="}},"text":"To  work  effectively,  the  Security  Onion  platform  must \r\ncollect data from various sources.

In  addition, \r\nthe Security Onion platform can collect and analyze logs from \r\nvarious applications and systems to detect suspicious behavior \r\nand unauthorized activity. IV. SECURITY OPERATION CENTER AS A SERVICE \r\nThere are many organizations that do not have the necessary \r\nresources  to  implement  their  own  SOC,  but  they  can adopt  an \r\noutsourced    solution    for    monitoring    and    managing    IT \r\ninfrastructure  security,  in  the  form  of  a  service: SOCaaS \r\n(Security Operation Center as a Service) (Fig. 2). SOCaaS  allows  organizations  to  benefit  from  the  expertise \r\nand  technologies  needed  to  protect  themselves  against  cyber \r\nthreats,  without  having  to  invest  their  own  resources  in  the \r\nanalysis  infrastructure  -  Manager,  Search  and  Elastic  Fleet \r\nStandalone  Node(s),  but  possibly  only  in  the  infrastructure  of \r\nacquisition of Sensor and Intrusion Detection Honeypot Node(s) \r\n[7]. Security  Service  Providers  can  set  up  IDH  nodes  as virtual \r\nmachines. By using the VXLAN tunneling protocol, they have \r\nthe capability to extend an organizational Layer 2 network over \r\nthe Internet and integrate the virtual IDH nodes in it. To ensure \r\ndata in transit is encrypted and authenticated, we encapsulate it \r\nin a Wireguard VPN tunnel, resulting a cost effective platform \r\nthat detects and analyzes cybersecurity threats [8]. We  use  GNS3  Network  Emulator  to  simulate  and  test  this \r\ntype  of  platform  and  validate  our  approach  (Fig. 3). In  our \r\nimplementation,  we  use  MikroTik  routers  that  have  a  version \r\nintended to be used as a virtual machine instance.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HQGXwmLZod+Q/ZXjE5cZC3eDq8+sTrf/GkGQkK4B3Dg="},"2b25f991-7ef6-42b6-a547-a227a2d2d13f":{"id_":"2b25f991-7ef6-42b6-a547-a227a2d2d13f","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"x7NH1KA22Vq1Y4kqngxl7XThTCu4nBlfxTL0M7nFL5k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1dcf3481-9a9e-45de-8c24-7d4c23479b33","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"HQGXwmLZod+Q/ZXjE5cZC3eDq8+sTrf/GkGQkK4B3Dg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"297e249f-65f1-4c7d-a2d1-dd4b477c2a8b","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"WTn05JnlrmqFGvS9rixGn0MbAMlj84izeZJFZdoeYFs="}},"text":"In order to keep the compatibility with older networks, in the \r\nSSP  network  we  create  VLANs  (one  for  each  connected \r\norganization) and place a virtual machine acting as IDH in each \r\nVLAN. Port  e0  in  SSP-SW  switch  configured  as  trunk  transports \r\nVLANs to the SSP-RTR router. Figure 3. The network simulated in GNS3. On the SSP router, we configure one bridge interface for each \r\norganization,  and  add  the  corresponding  VXLAN  and  VLAN \r\ninterfaces as bridge ports. After   configuring   all   devices,   we   test   successfully   the \r\nconnectivity between IDHs and the organizations’ networks.

V. CONCLUSIONS \r\nThis  paper  provides  a  brief  overview  of  the  benefits  and \r\nconsiderations  of  implementing  a  Security  Operation  Center \r\nwith open source components as a provided service (SOCaaS). Implementing a Security Operation Center using open-source \r\ntools  can  provide  organizations  with  a  high  level  of  cyber \r\nsecurity  at  a  significantly  reduced  cost  compared  to  traditional \r\ncommercial solutions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3F6lIAhODONDCuuWAsEzA2WTovg+IDN2l3O68DqjMIE="},"297e249f-65f1-4c7d-a2d1-dd4b477c2a8b":{"id_":"297e249f-65f1-4c7d-a2d1-dd4b477c2a8b","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf_5","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"x7NH1KA22Vq1Y4kqngxl7XThTCu4nBlfxTL0M7nFL5k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2b25f991-7ef6-42b6-a547-a227a2d2d13f","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"3F6lIAhODONDCuuWAsEzA2WTovg+IDN2l3O68DqjMIE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d23b4df8-7272-428e-b468-4c1da3b687c4","metadata":{"page_number":5,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf","file_name":"Implementation of a Security Operation Center - An Essential Cybersecurity Solution for Organizations.pdf"},"hash":"CfP3HV7FQTRReXOdXNHfUQryOm4ZrcnIydfI3BChzXU="}},"text":"By adopting an approach based on open-\r\nsource tools, organizations can build an efficient and affordable \r\nSOC   capable   of   meeting   the   ever-evolving   cybersecurity \r\nchallenges  but  they  also  can  use  SOCaaS  from  specialized \r\nproviders.

Selection of processes to be established \r\nis really what defines the SOC’s service portfolio. Without carefully crafting portfolio services, and thus \r\nprocesses, it is impossible to come up with the right investment plan for products and talent. For the processes described below, corresponding NIST standards have been selected as reference. Also, the \r\ninherent need for creating policies and procedures, defining roles and responsibilities, and assigning \r\nemployees to the roles have been omitted for all the processes listed here. LOG MANAGEMENT \r\n \r\nLogs are like records of what happens in a company's computer systems, especially when it comes to \r\nsecurity. They're made by things like antivirus software, operating systems, and apps. But handling these \r\nlogs properly is a big task. Log management includes making, sending, storing, looking at, and getting rid of \r\nthese security logs. Regularly checking logs is important for catching security problems, rule-breaking, and \r\nother issues. It helps with audits, investigations, and compliance. This project uses NIST SP 800-92 Guide to \r\nComputer Security Log Management [1] document as a reference. The challenge is dealing with lots of log sources, different content, formats, and too much data. It's tough \r\nbecause there's only so much we can do with limited resources. Managing logs also means keeping them \r\nsafe and making sure they're always available when needed. The guide for federal departments and agencies \r\ngives tips on how to handle these challenges. It probably suggests ways to use resources better, make log \r\nformats more consistent, and ensure that administrators regularly check logs properly. In a nutshell, the \r\nguide talks about how important it is to manage logs well for keeping computer systems safe and gives \r\nadvice on how to do that for government departments.

IDS/IPS \r\n \r\nIn the realm of cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are \r\ncrucial components designed to identify and respond to potential security threats within a network. These \r\nsystems play pivotal roles in proactively safeguarding digital assets, ensuring the integrity and \r\nconfidentiality of data, and mitigating the risks associated with cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): \r\n \r\nAn IDS is a monitoring tool that scrutinizes network and/or system activities to detect and alert on \r\nsuspicious or anomalous behavior. The primary objective is to identify potential security incidents by \r\nanalyzing patterns and deviations from established baselines. IDS operates in two main modes: signature-\r\nbased and anomaly-based detection. • Signature-Based Detection: This approach involves comparing observed activities against a \r\ndatabase of known attack signatures or patterns. If a match is found, the IDS raises an alert. Signature-based detection is effective against known threats but may struggle with new or \r\nsophisticated attacks that lack predefined signatures. • Anomaly-Based Detection: Anomaly-based IDS focuses on defining a baseline of normal network \r\nbehavior and alerting on deviations from that baseline. This method is more adept at detecting \r\nnovel or previously unseen attacks but may generate false positives if the baseline is not accurately \r\ncalibrated. IDS can be network-based, monitoring network traffic, or host-based, inspecting activities on individual \r\ndevices. Deployment of IDS contributes to early threat detection, aiding security teams in investigating and \r\nresponding to potential incidents promptly. However, IDS does not actively block or prevent malicious \r\nactivities; it solely serves to raise alarms for further investigation. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): \r\n \r\nIPS, on the other hand, builds upon the capabilities of IDS by not only detecting but also actively preventing \r\nor blocking malicious activities. An IPS operates inline with network traffic and can take immediate action \r\nto thwart potential threats. It combines the detection mechanisms of IDS with the ability to enforce security \r\npolicies and respond in real-time. • Signature-Based Prevention: Similar to IDS, IPS utilizes signature-based detection to identify \r\nknown threats and employs predefined rules to block or allow traffic accordingly.

Additionally, the configuration of IDS and IPS requires careful \r\ntuning to minimize false positives and negatives, ensuring effective and accurate threat detection and \r\nprevention. EDR \r\n \r\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution focused on identifying and mitigating \r\nsecurity threats at the endpoint level, such as individual devices like computers, servers, and mobile devices. In the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, traditional security measures often fall short in detecting and \r\nresponding to sophisticated attacks. EDR addresses this gap by providing advanced capabilities for \r\nmonitoring, analyzing, and responding to suspicious activities on endpoints. Key Components and Capabilities of EDR: \r\n \r\n• Continuous Monitoring: EDR solutions continually monitor endpoint activities in real-time. This \r\nincludes file and process executions, registry changes, network connections, and user behavior. The \r\nconstant surveillance allows for the early detection of anomalies and potential security incidents. • Behavioral Analysis: EDR employs behavioral analysis to establish a baseline of normal behavior \r\nfor each endpoint. Deviations from this baseline can be indicative of malicious activity. By \r\nunderstanding the typical actions of users and applications, EDR can identify anomalies that may \r\nsignify a security threat. • Threat Intelligence Integration: EDR systems are often integrated with threat intelligence feeds, \r\nincorporating up-to-date information about known malware, attack patterns, and indicators of \r\ncompromise. This integration enhances the system's ability to identify and respond to emerging \r\nthreats. • Incident Investigation and Response: When a potential threat is detected, EDR provides tools for \r\ndetailed investigation. Security analysts can review historical endpoint data, track the progression \r\nof an incident, and understand the scope and impact. Additionally, EDR allows for response \r\nactions, such as isolating an infected endpoint or blocking malicious processes. • Endpoint Isolation: EDR solutions can isolate compromised endpoints to prevent the lateral \r\nmovement of threats within a network. This containment capability helps minimize the potential \r\nimpact of an attack by restricting the compromised system's communication with other network \r\nresources. • Forensic Analysis: EDR tools often include forensic capabilities, enabling security teams to \r\nconduct in-depth analyses of security incidents. This involves examining artifacts left by malicious \r\nactivities, understanding the attack vectors, and gathering evidence for post-incident investigations.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mET/QbTBmiypoFEdTZ1uyyvZm5jJgauUhl2G5ePNVTg="},"d3543ffe-2b6b-4416-8560-859e19c4bed3":{"id_":"d3543ffe-2b6b-4416-8560-859e19c4bed3","metadata":{"page_number":24,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_24","metadata":{"page_number":24,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"xaaa71nxbBSzXFhrs0S17xYOOdimjfSKwRv2jUxwzc8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bd39e10a-043a-434f-8e74-dc9cfed16954","metadata":{"page_number":24,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"mET/QbTBmiypoFEdTZ1uyyvZm5jJgauUhl2G5ePNVTg="}},"text":"• Integration with SIEM: EDR solutions can be integrated with SIEM systems, creating a synergistic \r\nrelationship between endpoint data and broader network security information.

ANTIMALWARE SOLUTIONS \r\n \r\nAntimalware solutions, also known as antivirus, are essential components of cybersecurity designed to \r\ndetect, prevent, and remove malicious software, commonly referred to as malware. Malware encompasses a \r\nwide range of harmful software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware, and other \r\ntypes of malicious code. Antimalware solutions play a crucial role in protecting computer systems and \r\nnetworks from these threats. Key Features and Functionalities of Antimalware Solutions: \r\n \r\n• Signature-Based Detection: Traditional antimalware solutions often use signature-based detection. They maintain a database of known malware signatures, which are unique characteristics or \r\npatterns associated with specific malicious programs. When scanning files or processes, the \r\nsoftware compares them to these signatures to identify and quarantine known threats. • Heuristic Analysis: In addition to signature-based detection, many antimalware solutions use \r\nheuristic analysis to identify potential threats based on behavior or characteristics that may indicate \r\nmalicious intent. This allows the software to detect and respond to new or previously unknown \r\nmalware by recognizing suspicious patterns. • Behavioral Monitoring: Antimalware solutions monitor the behavior of programs and processes in \r\nreal-time. If a program behaves in a way consistent with malware (e.g., attempting to modify \r\ncritical system files or accessing sensitive data), the antimalware software can take action to \r\nprevent further malicious activity. • Real-Time Protection: Antimalware solutions provide real-time protection by actively scanning \r\nfiles, downloads, and system activities as they occur. This proactive approach helps prevent \r\nmalware from executing and causing harm before it can compromise the system.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"G08HSmG+TQwYFuRs+vI4cpOClaK2unnA2hxz1zblHlk="},"4c4eb83e-cccb-40f8-86fe-77455f0a9027":{"id_":"4c4eb83e-cccb-40f8-86fe-77455f0a9027","metadata":{"page_number":25,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf_25","metadata":{"page_number":25,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"oWzyGln+2HHsnTXUqOFCa2PCAcdKKFuPi8mMtft6vYI="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"854c5b3a-72e6-46b3-929e-48967624ccff","metadata":{"page_number":25,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Process, Technology and Human Aspects of a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"G08HSmG+TQwYFuRs+vI4cpOClaK2unnA2hxz1zblHlk="}},"text":"This proactive approach helps prevent \r\nmalware from executing and causing harm before it can compromise the system. • Automatic Updates: To stay effective against new and evolving threats, antimalware solutions \r\nregularly receive updates to their databases of malware signatures and heuristic algorithms.

A Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors a company’s digi-\r\ntal infrastructure to protect against these threats by detecting suspicious events and\r\ntaking mitigating action. Adversaries commonly need to access resources illegiti-\r\nmately to achieve action upon their objectives, and do so via existing user accounts. We develop a method to identify suspicious access behaviour using non-intrusive\r\ndata available to a SOC. For every user, a feature vector is constructed describing\r\ntheir access behaviour. This vector contains statistics over a predefined period of\r\ntime onwhat resourcesa user accessed atwhat timeand inwhat manner. We sur-\r\nvey different Machine Learning profiling possibilities and select the general-purpose\r\nK-means clustering to group users with similar behavioural characteristics. We apply this method to the Insider Threat logs from the Carnegie Mellon Uni-\r\nversity Software Engineering Institute, a synthetic dataset which is a benchmark for\r\ninsider threat detection research. Through access behaviour profiling, we were able\r\nto identify all users with the ITAdmin role. The consistency of clusters for benign\r\nusers over time was compared and quantified through the Adjusted Rand metric. Comparing consecutive months,  this resulted in an average consistency score of\r\n0.87. We were able to detect 80% of insider threats with the ITAdmin role by moni-\r\ntoring for changes in their cluster over time. Applying the same methodology to access data of real-world organisations al-\r\nlows for significantly less consistent clustering, with average consecutive month con-\r\nsistency scores of 0.41. We observe a slight similarity between our clusters and the\r\ngroupings within the organisation’s Active Directory. The clusters also show slight\r\nsimilarity with the groups inferred by Microsoft User Entity Behaviour and Analytics\r\nvia Machine Learning. We show how the granularity of the most relevant features\r\nof the synthetic dataset differs from that of real-world data, which is suspected to\r\ncause this decrease in clustering consistency. To  be  able  to  detect  suspicious  changes  in  user  access  behaviour  a  consis-\r\ntent profiling method is required. Our privacy-preserving, general-purpose profiling\r\nmethodology enabled consistent results on the synthetic dataset. However, we have\r\nstrong indication that in a production environment this data alone is not able to

access digital resources illegitimately is a part of almost every successful\r\ncyber attack. This research creates a method to profile users based on their access\r\nbehaviour using the data from a Security Operations Center (SOC). Having accu-\r\nrate user access profiles allows for detecting suspicious deviations in this behaviour,\r\nwhich  can  be  used  to  alert  a  SOC  analyst  to  take  a  closer  look  at  an  account’s\r\nactivity and determine whether the accesses could be malicious. One of the good practices regarding cyber security is the least privilege principle. If a user does not need to access a particular resource for their regular responsibil-\r\nities, their account should not have access to this resource. This is an example of\r\naccess control, which takes effort to keep track of and maintain over time. For exam-\r\nple, if someone leaves a the company, their accesses should be revoked. In reality,\r\nthis is often not done correctly [1], causing accounts to have more privileges than\r\nrequired. This becomes a problem when an adversary manages to gain control of\r\nthis account, known as account compromise, or when a user turns against their em-\r\nployer, called an insider threat. If a domain admin account gets compromised with\r\nall the access rights they possess, it will pose a security risk even when adhering\r\nto the least privilege principle. Therefore it is crucial to not only survey the access\r\ncontrol policies but also consider the actual accesses an account performs to detect\r\nsuspicious activity, which is where a SOC comes into play. The goal of a SOC is to detect suspicious events within an organisation’s digital\r\ninfrastructure. Multiple data sources can be used for detection,  such as sensors\r\nwithin the network to capture traffic, logs of servers and logs of end-point devices. A\r\nSecurity Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is used to combine and\r\ncorrelate this data. Using this SIEM, a SOC looks for suspicious events such as an\r\naccount being granted admin privileges or a user visiting a possible phishing web-\r\nsite. Not every detection implies a security risk. Actions labelled as suspicious can\r\nhave been performed legitimately, or the detection rule can be faulty.

INTRODUCTION\r\ndetection causes manual labour for an analyst to verify the detection’s legitimacy, it\r\nis a SOC’s goal to finetune its detection rules. The detections should trigger on as\r\nmany security risks as possible, this is called a True Positive. The other possibilities\r\ninclude events without actual risk, called False Positives, from which we want as few\r\nas possible. Additionally, the rate of actual security threats going undetected, called\r\nFalse Negatives, should naturally be as close to zero as possible. The digital infrastructure of an organisation usually contains ‘crown jewels’, which\r\nare  their  most  valuable  assets. These  can  be  on-premise  servers  such  as  file\r\nservers, Domain Controllers (DCs) and mail exchange servers. DCs host a domain’s\r\nActive Directory (AD), which imposes user and device policies. A compromise of the\r\nDC can lead to malicious policies being executed on all of an organisation’s domain-\r\njoined devices, such as employee laptops. A file server usually contains much of\r\nan organisation’s confidential data, which should only be accessed by those with a\r\nlegitimate reason. Because we use access as an indicator for potentially malicious\r\nbehaviour,  these resource types are our main points of focus. The input data in\r\nthis research is limited to access events within the Windows Event log to remain\r\nas little invasive on user’s behavioural data as possible, whilst being able to make\r\ninferences on suspicious accounts. When behavioural monitoring raises an alert\r\nfor the SOC, the alert needs to clarifywhya certain user account was marked as\r\nsuspicious to assist the analyst in their further investigation. This reasoning is also\r\na requirement from ethical perspective,  as it is impermissible to have an opaque\r\nalgorithm labelling users for suspicion. This process needs to be as transparent and\r\nexplainable as possible. Detection rules within a SIEM describe when to raise an alert, based on log en-\r\ntries. An alert is a suspicious activity that a SOC analyst looks into to determine\r\nits legitimacy and takes action upon if it is suspected to be malicious. Frequently,\r\nsuch rules are static in determining suspicious events. However, this poses a prob-\r\nlem when creating a profile based on behaviour, as this is a dynamic characteristic.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2kjR2iKSmapanQW5BfXvUPVHhB38CqHhD8mBs103w1c="},"0e41e8aa-ca1c-41fa-973f-8471342e9d03":{"id_":"0e41e8aa-ca1c-41fa-973f-8471342e9d03","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"1O9zCKFDRK47J8ffSrnXa3KOFNqoZeTZMfzwocvnuIg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"65e7fd8f-9695-4317-99dd-5d22f8560fcc","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"2kjR2iKSmapanQW5BfXvUPVHhB38CqHhD8mBs103w1c="}},"text":"Therefore, this research aims to develop a novel methodology using existing meth-\r\nods to create user behavioural profiles from access logs and be able to detect sus-\r\npicious deviations from this profile over time, by using non-invasive data available to\r\na SOC.

To answer this question and guide this research, we need to answer the following\r\nsub-questions:\r\n1.Which non-invasive features readily available to a SOC are relevant in\r\ndescribing user access behaviour? Using both related literature and threat intelligence, we infer relevant features\r\nto keep track of regarding access behaviour. 2.Which explainable machine learning method can be used to profile users? Of the available Machine Learning methods, we choose one which fits our pur-\r\npose as explainable, simple and genericly applicable approach. 3.How does our profiling methodology perform within the CERT v4.2 syn-\r\nthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups? The  CERT  Insider  Threat  dataset  contains  data  on  every  user’s  role  within\r\nthe artificial company and spans a large period. Therefore we can compare\r\nour clusters to these role groups and measure how stable the clusters are for\r\nbenign users over time. 4.How does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data in terms\r\nof consistency and extracted user groups? We profile users by applying our methodology to login data available to a SOC\r\nand measure how stable the clustering is over time.

First,  we\r\ndescribe the data available to a SOC which can be used to reach our objective. Second,  the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) processes and\r\npossibilities are explained. Finally, we highlight the Data Science fundamentals re-\r\nquired to understand the methodology of this research. 2.1    SOC Access Data\r\nA SOC has several methods of monitoring digital infrastructure. By inserting sen-\r\nsors  into  the  network,  traffic  can  be  captured  to  detect  which  hosts  interact  with\r\neach other and possibly inspect the payload. Server logs are very useful, as these\r\nare central parts of the infrastructure with which many users directly or indirectly\r\ninteract. Organisations generally use a domain to manage their devices. A domain\r\nis a group of computers within a network administered by a central server, the Do-\r\nmain Controller (DC). Accounts within the domain can log onto every device they are\r\nauthorised to, using their domain account and password. Domain accounts authen-\r\nticate against the DC to log onto such devices and resources. There are multiple\r\ntypes of authentication, which are some of the events the SOC can monitor to de-\r\ntermine a user’s access behaviour. In addition to servers and networks, endpoint\r\ndevices such as employee laptops or phones can be monitored, as these types of\r\ndevices can provide access to company resources.

BACKGROUND\r\nsend a subset of their Windows Events logs2  3to this SIEM for analysis. To access a resource, a user must first authenticate to prove they are authorised. In the Windows domain this is commonly performed via the default protocol Kerberos\r\n[3], which uses tickets distributed by the DC, or the fall-back NTLM4, a challenge-\r\nresponse mechanism. When a user accesses a resource after valid authentication,\r\nWindows Event 4624 is logged:An account was successfully logged on. This event\r\ncontains, amongst others, information on the time, user, target host, authentication\r\ntype, connection method and source IP. If a user logs off, this generates events 4634\r\nor 4647, which include similar information. 2.2    Microsoft Sentinel\r\nThe  real-world  data  part  of  this  research  is  performed  using  the  Microsoft  Sen-\r\ntinel SIEM5. Sentinel is a cloud solution that,  among others,  can be used to in-\r\ngest logs from endpoint devices. The data is saved in tables and queried using\r\nthe Kusto  Query Language (KQL). The tables  used for this  research include the\r\nSecurityEventtable, which contains the ingested Windows Events. Azure Active\r\nDirectory (AAD) is an identity and access management tool organisations can use\r\nto sign into apps using Single Sign-On (SSO). Suppose the on-premise AD is syn-\r\nchronised with the Azure Active Directory. In that case, it is possible to correlate\r\nthe on-premise accounts with cloud accounts and perform further analyses using\r\nUser and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)6. This produces two additional tables:\r\nIdentityInfoandUserPeerAnalytics. IdentityInfo displays a combination of on-\r\npremise and cloud properties of an account. UserPeerAnalytics provides a list of\r\nup to 20 ranked peers for any AAD account, generated using Microsoft’s machine-\r\nlearning algorithm applied to all of its connected data sources. Since the peer ana-\r\nlytics table is based on cloud accounts and our analysis is performed by monitoring\r\non-premise accesses, the accounts need to be correlated using the IdentityInfo table\r\nas shown in Figure 2.1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"km0tWecoRvwU+5GgWGlZ+d6LNUf2ecJn9puG3cJ/vcg="},"a499e615-ce17-4acd-9a45-7a8b2d87f77c":{"id_":"a499e615-ce17-4acd-9a45-7a8b2d87f77c","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"KGfx4iHMKmO+/CXBAg7y+c83VHN34pRPwBwDmcGxqQo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"778883b2-20d6-4238-a9ce-0a88514d0a71","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"km0tWecoRvwU+5GgWGlZ+d6LNUf2ecJn9puG3cJ/vcg="}},"text":"2Windows      Event      list:https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/\r\nencyclopedia/\r\n3Windows  Events  sent  to  a  SIEM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/\r\nwindows-security-event-id-reference\r\n4NTLM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\r\n5Microsoft Sentinel:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview\r\n6Sentinel UEBA:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ueba-reference","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iNnZT3JzCAtIoAltwCoDUlqKLL8iB4woVMLdM1po+BA="},"67435ca2-a5cb-4453-8a24-0864a04fd414":{"id_":"67435ca2-a5cb-4453-8a24-0864a04fd414","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"f/OWmVhEMsaULaBs/ZJoH0wGNLLRvOr+V7oh7zMsR+U="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c80cc9b5-2c4f-4e73-816e-f505b696842e","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"Y4shvdoBnJpdzfK6otg6+A6NtqGUhwKtiDawPclVCnM="}},"text":"2.3.

The way we\r\napply these methods are further discussed in the methodology section. K-means clustering\r\nThis  section  describes  the  clustering  approach,  a  choice  which  is  further  moti-\r\nvated in Section 3.5. There are different possibilities for clustering points in a multi-\r\ndimensional area. In our case of user clustering, every point represents a user and\r\na  feature  vector  is  a  list  of  numerical  properties  describing  the  user’s  behaviour. Every feature within a user’s feature vector is translated to a dimension within the\r\nmultidimensional area. K-Means aims to partition objects in this multi-dimensional\r\nspace intonclusters. This is achieved by minimising the ’Within-Cluster Sum of\r\nSquares’ and maximising the ’Between-Cluster Sum of Squares’.The naive version\r\nof the algorithm uses the following steps, which are further illustrated by Figure 2.2:\r\n•Step 1:Initialisationselectnrandom points in multi-dimensional space to be\r\nthe initial ’centroid’\r\n•Step 2:InitialisationAssociate each point to its closest ’centroid’\r\n•Step 3:Compute the gravitational centre, the centroid, for each label\r\n•Step 4:Associate each point with their closest centroid\r\n•Step 5:Repeat from step 3 until convergence, or halt if the centroids do not\r\nmove anymore. The parameter provided to the K-Means clustering algorithm is the number of\r\nclusters, which influences every of the clustering steps. An extra centroid means\r\nthat the results of steps 3 and 4 of the algorithm will be different. Additionally, there is\r\na factor of chance in the algorithm. Picking the initial centroid points is performed at\r\nrandom, so selecting different points could cause the centroids to travel in a different\r\ndirection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fc7a1mn4BoEO2R3AOZj/+Lj+ajaLatDKxNdfqgpOjbc="},"c80cc9b5-2c4f-4e73-816e-f505b696842e":{"id_":"c80cc9b5-2c4f-4e73-816e-f505b696842e","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"f/OWmVhEMsaULaBs/ZJoH0wGNLLRvOr+V7oh7zMsR+U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"67435ca2-a5cb-4453-8a24-0864a04fd414","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"fc7a1mn4BoEO2R3AOZj/+Lj+ajaLatDKxNdfqgpOjbc="}},"text":"Hence it is essential to reproducibility to seed the randomness so that,\r\ngiven the same data,  the algorithm will result in the same clusters when applied","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Y4shvdoBnJpdzfK6otg6+A6NtqGUhwKtiDawPclVCnM="},"7d6f767a-a51d-4cab-87e3-6d8250109ec5":{"id_":"7d6f767a-a51d-4cab-87e3-6d8250109ec5","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"o6GRBs5kZ2lEhxOtDaRS/jMBJA1/xEpK+ldA0FyA6j0="}},"text":"8                                                                                                  CHAPTER2.

(Adjusted) Rand index\r\nA metric is required to measure how similar the clusters from different periods in time\r\nare. For this, we compare how users are divided amongst the clusters for different\r\niterations of the algorithm. This is not as trivial as counting the number of users\r\nclassified into different clusters, as the number of users designated to a cluster can\r\nchange. For  this,  we  apply  the  adjusted  Rand  index7,  a  function  measuring  the\r\nsimilarity of two separate cluster divisions. This metric was initially developed by\r\nRand [4], but because of the underlying formula, it often returns a value close to 1\r\nwhen comparing different sets of labels. The Rand index method was later optimised\r\nby Hubert et al. [5] to compensate for this factor of chance. We therefore apply the\r\nadjusted Rand score in this research. Quantify feature importance\r\nTo investigate what the most defining features are that caused a user to be classi-\r\nfied into a certain cluster, we apply the ’Unsupervised to Supervised’ method, using\r\nan external library8. We selected this method as opposed to alternative options be-\r\ncause of its easy steps and explainability.

First,  we\r\nsurvey the literature about the threats of improper user access control and detection\r\npossibilities. Then,  we look at anomaly detection mechanisms based on access\r\nlogs. Finally, we visit the work benchmarking their anomaly detection algorithms on\r\nthe synthetic CERT Insider Threat dataset. 3.1    Access Control\r\nFor a user account to access a resource, they require the appropriate permissions. Within an organisation’s digital infrastructure, this is usually arranged via Active Di-\r\nrectory groups. A group can be granted read and write rights to a resource. If a user\r\nis a member of this group, they inherit all these rights. Managing such accesses\r\nfor users and groups is calledAccess control. The Principle of Least Privilege is\r\na concept within information security which describes that users should only have\r\naccess to the resources they need. Not adhering to this principle forms a security\r\nrisk if an adversary manages to control an account, such as in the case of account\r\ncompromise or insider threats. Research has tried to detect misconfigurations in such policies using different\r\napproaches. Das et al. [6] created Baaz: a tool that represents access control poli-\r\ncies  as  a  matrix,  which  for  every  user  (column)  and  every  resource  (row)  states\r\nwhether access is granted. If a reference dataset exists on which resources every\r\nrole should be able to access,  users can be mapped to a role group with similar\r\nrights. The resources that share the same policies are clustered if no reference\r\nmatrix is available. From this, clusters of users with roughly the same access per-\r\nmissions can be produced. After the clustering step, users and resources which do\r\nnot fit into any cluster are marked as outliers. In this case,  anOutliercan imply\r\nusers with too many permissions, a security issue, and users who have too few per-\r\n11","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uqq+W2fEspkYAoLp1GQeLVSxiB3yDJiSUSdglQCyWCc="},"e69db596-4bd2-44dc-a46d-cee6ec9b0341":{"id_":"e69db596-4bd2-44dc-a46d-cee6ec9b0341","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"6Wjl+5Mqo0AP8fTJOgfoG8wbi58RsiYnj2tqfg0dsWc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ce0188b9-0d07-4123-92d1-3a7a78f24259","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"s58rW6PDI/0l3pzCwJY3I+fmVYS2a7VgyDGIMfKd/5A="}},"text":"12                                                                                             CHAPTER3. RELATEDWORK\r\nmissions, an accessibility issue. The detection of accessibility issues is, to us, not\r\na goal in itself, but repeated access requests through misconfigurations could lead\r\nto  administrators  becoming  too  generous  in  granting  access  permissions,  hence\r\nleading to security issues again. In reality,  such well-documented access control\r\nmatrices or even a reference dataset on roles and resources are often not available. Therefore is more realistic to perform analyses on logs. Bauer et al. [7] performed\r\nlog analysis to analyse the access attempts foraccessibilityproblems. They used\r\nassociation rule mining [8], a type of inference that tries to predict future accesses\r\nthrough previous ones. Because such rules can repeatedly produce the same false\r\nassociation, a feedback mechanism was introduced to prevent these mistakes from\r\nreoccurring. However, since such labelling is performed manually, when applied on\r\na larger scale it becomes labour-intensive, which is undesirable to a SOC. 3.2    Relational database user profiling through access\r\nlogs\r\nOne of the goals of profiling users through access logs is to detect deviations from\r\nthe norm. This is a use case foranomaly detection, for example, when someone\r\nsuddenly changes behaviour to access more resources than usual or logs in outside\r\nof office hours. The research area of user profiling and anomaly detection using logs is more\r\nmature within the field of relational databases. Even though this is a specific type\r\nof resource access, their methodologies are still relevant when considering broader\r\nresource types. Kamra et al. [9] mined SQL queries from the database audit logs,\r\ncreating profiles to model normal database access behaviour. These profiles consist\r\nofquiplets, extracting different fields from the SQL query to determine what data is\r\nqueried, such as tables, columns and constraints.

While the system learns\r\nthe user’s behaviour, it reaches an equilibrium where rarely any new anomalies are\r\ndetected after a while. The research compares the different monitoring elements by\r\nplacing a different person than the authenticated account in front of the computer,\r\nhaving them perform exercises and testing how long it takes for every element to\r\nmark the user’s behaviour as anomalous. The keystrokes and viewed sites features\r\nrecognised anomalous behaviour the quickest, but a weighted combination of all fea-\r\ntures performed the best. For access behaviour, a similar approach could be used\r\nby converting every feature into a numerical value, giving weight to every feature,\r\nand testing against the historical profile whether there is a statistical difference. If\r\nthere is a difference, its weight score gets added to the cumulative anomaly score\r\nevery interval. The session is marked as anomalous if the anomaly score crosses a\r\nthreshold. Wang et al. [12] analysed user behaviour through characteristics similar to those\r\nused  by  Pannell  [11]. As  they  only  test  on  labelled  datasets,  a  supervised  ML\r\napproach is possible through the use of Support Vector Machines. Their dataset\r\nincludes biometric information, and they found that this characteristic worked well\r\nin profiling the correct individual and identifying whether the authenticated account\r\nbelongs to the user behind the computer interactions. However, their testing setup\r\nallows for making assumptions on legitimate training data without anomalies and re-\r\nquires detailed datasets on user-computer interactions. Thus, the nature of this data\r\nand training assumptions make it infeasible to apply their method within a SOC. When teaching an algorithm to distinguish between different users in audit sessions,\r\nif users share many behavioural traits, this causes many false positives. This issue\r\nwas recognised by Garchery et al. [13], who went on to group similar individual users\r\ninto clusters and found this led to better overall performance. Their approach to user\r\nrepresentation and clustering is confusion matrices with actual and predicted users\r\non the different axes.

GMMs allow for a mixture of probability distributions, which is helpful for mon-\r\nitoring behaviour as this can change slowly over time. Their solution has a feedback\r\nloop through analysts to improve detection, as the analysts’ input is a labelled obser-\r\nvation.

Role information can also be included, as different roles may have\r\ndifferent suspicious behaviour, such as the sales department mailing many files to\r\npeople outside the company.

Those\r\n’distance scores’ are used to create a feature vector per user, and those features\r\ncan be used to identify users and detect anomalies if a threshold is crossed. This\r\nscoring system is the core of the entire anomaly detection, but Gates et al. claim that\r\nthis methodology also applies to domains outside the file system hierarchy. Another\r\nexample is the shortest path between two URLs:  how many hyperlinks it takes to\r\nget from one internet page to the other. The core of this detection mechanism is that\r\nthere needs to be a numerical distance to express similarity between two accesses,\r\nwhich is hard to apply within our access type without significant domain knowledge\r\nof the network and occupations. This approach is likely not suitable for our research. We have seen so far that related work can perform proper detection of malicious\r\nactivity on user accounts, but mainly by profiling the user interaction with the com-\r\nputer itself, contrary to just the access properties. This leads to substantial feature\r\nvectors per person fed into an ML algorithm, which can perform well. Such experi-\r\nments were, however, mostly performed in an experimental setting with intensively\r\nmonitored test subjects. This,  in practice,  is undesirable,  if not impossible,  for a\r\nSOC.

These\r\nactions are kept track of within both static time windows and user sessions to com-\r\npare performance. They used the CERT v4.2 dataset to benchmark their approach. Sharma recognises that it is harder to find a trade-off between false positives and\r\nmissing anomalies when using fixed time windows to extract features. It is hard to\r\ndetect an anomaly for short windows, whilst for large windows, the behaviour could\r\nbecome too generic. Therefore, the model takes all events within one session as\r\nfeature vector input, which comprises 44 features. These events include numerical\r\nfeatures such as to how many devices a connection was made or how many job\r\nsearching websites were visited and categorical features such as the role or func-\r\ntional unit. All numbers are normalised to a range of (0,1). Sharma et al. found that\r\noff-hour activity is critical information, just as whether usage is from a user’s regular\r\npc. Their feature vectors are chronologically divided into training, validation and test-\r\ning.

RELATEDWORK\r\nAs the CERT dataset includes different malicious scenarios, Le also tested which\r\napproaches work best for what type of scenario. They performed classification of\r\nboth instances (one log entry or feature vector) and users (whether an employee\r\nturned malicious at some point). From these two, the user-based detection resulted\r\nin  the  highest  precision  rates. Additionally,  for  the  RF  classifier,  they  performed\r\nfeature analysis based on Gini impurity. This is used to infer how important every\r\nfeature within the vector is for the ML algorithm. Realising this effectivity per type\r\nof threat scenario and the importance of different features is very useful to realise\r\nwhat input data is relevant and what types of threats still go undetected. After ap-\r\nplying supervised ML approaches,  the same authors performed an unsupervised\r\nlearning-based anomaly detection approach for insider threat detection [23]. They\r\napplied four methods: Auto-encoders, Isolation Forest, Lightweight On-line detection\r\nof anomalies, and Local Outlier Factor. Additionally, they varied the representation\r\nof temporal information within data, optimising how behavioural changes over time\r\nare detected. Variations include concatenating feature vectors from a specific time-\r\nframe, explicitly adding the percentile, or the difference between a number and its\r\nmean or median, to the feature vector. Every CERT version dataset has a differ-\r\nent organisational structure and scenarios. They looked into their model’s generic\r\napplicability and robustness for different datasets by training on one CERT dataset\r\nversion and applying it to another. Finally, applying multiple algorithms allows vot-\r\ning:  An event is only marked as anomalous if the number of algorithms marking it\r\nanomalous crosses a threshold. Combining the knowledge this way improved their\r\napproach’s detection ability and robustness.

Pannell et al. keep track of a user by counting specific actions, also referred\r\nto asfrequency feature,  over a session of 30 seconds,  such as keystroke analy-\r\nsis and the amount of running applications. For access behaviour, other elements\r\ncould be kept track of and counted in a time interval, such as the different destination\r\nhosts, authentication methods and logon types. Sharma et al. used a session-based\r\napproach instead of a predefined timeframe. They kept track of, amongst others,\r\nwhether a logon was during working hours, the day of the week and the logon until\r\nlogoff session duration. User activities were tracked by Tuor et al. by counting them\r\nin a 24-hour time window. For every action taken by the user a value was increased,\r\nbased on a decision tree, such as a separate counter for a logon action between 12\r\nam and 6 am. Le et al. found that for frequency features, the session-based and 24-\r\nhour time windows data worked best. In addition to frequency features, they used\r\nstatistical features:  descriptive statistics such as the mean, median and standard\r\ndeviation of properties related to user actions. From this, as they kept track of all\r\nactivity within the session, too, we infer that the daily frequency features will suit our\r\napproach best.

The profiling of user behaviour and detection of its deviations is tackled in dif-\r\nferent ways in the literature. The two main ways of processing the feature vectors\r\nto profile user behaviour are via statistical tests or ML. Statistical tests allow for a\r\nsimple method of giving different weights to vectors. On the other hand, ML is more\r\nwidely used by related work and has yielded better results. Most often, a type of\r\nanomaly  detection  was  used  to  detect  insider  threats  or  compromised  accounts,\r\nranging from, e.g. LSTM Auto-encoders to Gaussian Mixed Models. Applying such\r\na mechanism is out of scope for this research, as it would require further research\r\non  which  types  of  anomaly  detection  are  suitable  for  CERT  and  production  data\r\nand how they work under the hood. Anomaly detection is possible in both a su-\r\npervised and unsupervised manner. However, the supervised version is generally\r\nonly suitable when ground truth is available on, for example, insiders or user roles. Before able to detect anomalies, we need to be able to profile users meaningfully\r\nand consistently over time. For that, we focus on clustering to develop this profiling\r\nmethodology.

Therefore we decided to\r\nuse the general-purpose, straightforward K-means clustering algorithm, which solely\r\nrequires the desired amount of clusters as input parameters, which can be gener-\r\nated using the Elbow heuristic. The main drawback of this algorithm is that it does\r\nnot perform very well on clusters of different sizes. This could, in future research, be\r\nsolved by profiling the feature vectors before clustering and selecting the clustering\r\napproach based on this, but discovering the perfect clustering algorithm falls outside\r\nof the scope of this research. Access log data used\r\nThere are multiple stages where it is possible to monitor user access behaviour. During authentication via Kerberos,  when a user authenticates against the DC a\r\nWindows Event describes what type of service a TGS (Ticket Granting Server) had\r\nbeen requested for. Then a user logs onto the host and performs actions on this\r\ndevice. Our goal is to detect it when a user suspiciously changes access behaviour\r\nfrom their regular profile. We want this detection to be as generally applicable as\r\npossible. Logged authentication events are hard to correlate because TGSs are\r\ncommonly not sent to the SIEM and authentication tokens are valid for en extended\r\nperiod of time, making monitoring difficult for, e.g. outside office hour activity. We\r\nalso need to decide which devices we can use the logs from. Logs from endpoint de-\r\nvices such as employee laptops generate many events. Since there are many such\r\ndevices, a SIEM would be flooded with data if they were all onboarded to the SIEM. Therefore, these endpoint devices are commonly not onboarded, making them hard\r\nto monitor. As previously mentioned, servers are among the most valuable assets\r\nwithin an organisation, so we will limit our monitoring to those servers. Additionally,\r\nmany employee devices will need to connect to such servers to access domain-\r\nwide resources. Therefore we limit our focus to the actual logon event (4624) onto\r\nservers,  as this allows us to observewhich accountconnected towhich hostat\r\nwhich timeandhow. Logoff events can be included to determine session duration. Feature construction\r\nUsing related literature and threat intelligence,  we formed an approach to create\r\nfeature vectors from access logs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"vLtYVuKwDj673gfFwFRaKKBxhLXp3e06zoKbHdYTNJI="},"8aa9bef5-a4e4-42aa-8901-133f17cdcd32":{"id_":"8aa9bef5-a4e4-42aa-8901-133f17cdcd32","metadata":{"page_number":27,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_27","metadata":{"page_number":27,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"g423jXAJS5qOW2BmwfNOotmrhuqTQmharjQZGZoN8hE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"285d555d-5a58-48da-be1b-b08d45867c28","metadata":{"page_number":27,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"vLtYVuKwDj673gfFwFRaKKBxhLXp3e06zoKbHdYTNJI="}},"text":"Within time windows of 24 hours, several access\r\nproperties are counted per user, such as destination host and whether the access\r\nwas  performed  outside  of  office  hours.

Therefore for this dataset we focus on the temporal aspects of\r\nthe accesses. 2) Feature engineering\r\nTo create feature vectors we need to look at more than just how many times a user\r\naccessed a certain PC, especially because for this dataset there are only few re-\r\nsources shared amongst many people.

Too many users with identical access behaviour\r\nskews the K-means clustering method, as there will be large number of users with\r\nthe same feature vector. This causes a huge ’gravitational center’, meaning most\r\ncentroids will move towards this user group. This lowers the granularity to which\r\nother users can be classified into clusters. Additionally, such users are less suspi-\r\ncious when ignoring the significance of certain machines.

METHODOLOGY\r\nOffice HoursAnother important characteristic within logon data is whether a logon\r\ntook place during or outside of office hours [18]. A user accessing more resources\r\noutside of office hours than regular could be indication for an account compromise. Therefore for every timeframe, we calculate how many of the logins were outside of\r\noffice hours. For weekdays this is defined as before 7:00 or after 21:00, as based on\r\n5.1. A weekend access is always outside of office hours. From these features per\r\ntimeframe we also calculate the mean, median and standard deviation as statistical\r\nfeatures. The same features per timeframe and corresponding statistical features\r\nare computed for accesseswithinoffice hours. Novel accessesPer timeframe, we count how many of the resources were ac-\r\ncessed for the first time:newlyaccessedresourceamtintimeframeyyyymmdd. This is important to profile an account used for network discovery or propagation. Such behaviour will make many accesses for the first time, ones which the legiti-\r\nmate user or the person whilst they were still acting benign had the rights to but\r\nnever previously accessed. As with the above features, the mean, median and stan-\r\ndard deviation statistical features are computed. Cumulative  difference  from  the  meanTo  find  patterns  in  changing  behaviour\r\nover time,  we introduce a new feature:  thecumulative difference from mean ac-\r\ncesses until timeframe X. This feature is used to keep track of trends over time,\r\nsuch as a user continuing to access more resources over time. This feature can be\r\ncompared to the Cumulative Sum control chart (CUSUM). The CUSUM is a method\r\nto monitor change: A temporal sequence of values is standardised and compared to\r\nthe expected value.

Therefore, per cluster, we compute the\r\nmean, median and standard deviation of every feature.

First, to see if clusters can be\r\nuser to group people of the same role, we compare the clusters via the role informa-\r\ntion as provided in the CERT dataset.

We use the version\r\nwhich adjusts for chance, to compensate for ’lucky guesses’ by our clustering algo-\r\nrithm. Another method to quantify clustering performance is to see how stable they are\r\nover time. This is achieved by applying the clustering algorithm based on the data of\r\ne.g. one month, and doing this for several months during a year. Then, we compare\r\neach month pair-wise via the abovementioned Rand index, using just the data from\r\nusers which were active in both periods and filtering out the malicious actors. This\r\nwill result per pair of months, a score on how similar the clusterings are. There is to\r\nour knowledge no literature performing such comparison over time hence we have\r\nno baseline of what values would be acceptable or good. Therefore, we assume that\r\nbenign user’s behaviour does not change between months and aim for the values\r\nclosest to 1.0 as possible, as this would mean an identical clustering.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PL1nNK8EHba/5HbERGf8cz+PQkifQvUUy2vr72AddjI="},"5e8c267f-01b5-4412-ab25-5ea30e3d545c":{"id_":"5e8c267f-01b5-4412-ab25-5ea30e3d545c","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_37","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"K9r0sLy4hbfffSQ71za+hNM+WGRkglExJuzhXHNMkv0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a288137a-3826-4f7e-a876-eafa1754ac58","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"PL1nNK8EHba/5HbERGf8cz+PQkifQvUUy2vr72AddjI="}},"text":"Having stable clusters means a SOC can take a user’s access behaviour over\r\na certain time period, compare it to the behaviour of all other users and determine\r\nwhose behaviour is alike.

METHODOLOGY\r\naccess behaviour change. A SOC analyst would take a closer look at the histori-\r\ncal behaviour of the user and gather contextual data to determine whether the be-\r\nhaviour is potentially malicious. If too many users change clusters two problems\r\narise when comparing different time periods. First, as a SOC analyst looks at all\r\nusers changing behaviour to determine its legitimacy, more users being marked as\r\nhaving suspicious behaviour leads to an increase in manual workload. Second, if\r\nusers change behaviour this will affect the location of their cluster’s centroid. The\r\ndynamic element of changing human behaviour is part of the reason why we ex-\r\npected ML to be more suitable for suspicious change detection rather than static\r\nthresholds. However, if many users change behaviour and thereby possible switch\r\nclusters, this affects the locations of all centroids. Then, it is not trivial anymore to\r\ndetermine which centroid’s cluster belonged to which group of users. Determining\r\nthis is necessary to detect which users changed behaviour more than the rest of\r\ntheir cluster. Therefore, this approach would only work if the number of distinguish-\r\nable user groups stays the same, and that the majority of the users stay in their own\r\ncluster over time. Huge behavioural shifts could be avoided by using smaller time\r\nperiods, however this increases the dataset skew as relative changes have a greater\r\ninfluence so might work counterproductive. We go further into this in Section 6.3. 4.2    Sentinel\r\nFor the analysis within Sentinel the analysis methodology is comparable to CERT’s\r\nSection 4.1, only the data types and performance quantification possibilities are dif-\r\nferent. Section 2.2 elaborates further on the functioning of Sentinel, including the\r\ndata and analysis possibilities. The analysis is performed within a Sentinel Note-\r\nbook, which is a Jupyter Notebook whose kernel runs on an Azure virtual machine. The Sentinel Notebook supports Python, ML libraries and supports integration with\r\nlogs stored in Sentinel. 1) Ethical caveat\r\nBecause this research incorporates data generated by humans, it requires approval\r\nby the ethics committee of the University of Twente. To gain this approval, we had to\r\nset strict limits on what our data and inferences can and cannot be used for. Because the dataset concerns human behaviour, a skew towards users behaving\r\nin  a  particular  manner  is  certainly  possible.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"eFhJ1VQFKNVFHqfexLBu1ACZTWwkANiBfSROwDFO5ZI="},"98fa6bf3-8ee9-4fc3-9403-0aee4a9b98b2":{"id_":"98fa6bf3-8ee9-4fc3-9403-0aee4a9b98b2","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_38","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"lRclK/1Hgii7IWVcW/qvn9dgnDzk1oQUyHPIfwPDXvs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"eb97d27d-d08b-4fe7-a28b-da40e093d544","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"eFhJ1VQFKNVFHqfexLBu1ACZTWwkANiBfSROwDFO5ZI="}},"text":"We  need  to  keep  this  skew  for  this\r\napproach to function in the real world.

Furthermore, the Department\r\nand Jobtitle fields would be suitable as they place the users in distinct groups, how-\r\never in practice these are not filled out for a large portion of an organisation’s users,\r\nharming the analysis possibilities.

Therefore we need a different\r\nmethod to compare our clustering to these group memberships. The method for this\r\nis described in Algorithm 1. This results in a score between 0 and 1 per user, which\r\nis the average similarity per user.

This equalises the importance of all individual fea-\r\ntures, as they all have the same range, limiting the influence of outliers. The relative\r\ndifference between a feature’s value between different users stays the same. Another method of standardisation is achieved through QuantileTransformers11. This\r\nmethod  transforms  the  feature  values  to  follow  a  uniform  or  normal  distribution. Through this, the relative distance to outliers are reduced which limits their impact. Additionally,  values which are close together are spread out through this type of\r\ntransformation. Different clustering method\r\nAs the K-means clustering approach simply classifies the users closest to a centroid\r\ninto one cluster, this could blur the boundaries between clusters and is heavily in-\r\nfluenced by the randomised initial position of the centroids. In addition, it does not\r\nrecognise clusters of different sizes well, whereas we could expect organisations to\r\nnot have evenly distributed groups of users with similar access behaviour. There-\r\nfore, we apply the DBSCAN clustering approach12to get an indication whether this\r\ncould outperform K-means clustering with regards to clustering consistency or com-\r\nparison to peers and AD groups. DBSCAN clustering recognises densely populated\r\nareas in a multidimensional space and groups the users within such areas together\r\nin a cluster. If an area is not densely populated, then the users within this area are\r\nnot put into a cluster at all. A single parameter is required for this function: theep-\r\nsilon. This parameter describes the maximum distance between two points for them\r\nto be considered in each others neighbourhood. A higher epsilon value will lead to\r\nless dense points being included in the cluster. Longer period of time for feature vector creation\r\nWhilst requiring significantly more resources in computing power and time, the data\r\nof multiple weeks could be aggregated together to take the data of an entire month\r\ninto account when creating the feature vectors. This reduces the influence that minor\r\nbehavioural changes such as a vacation day or tasks which are not executed on a\r\nweekly basis could have on the clustering classification. Hence, we would expect\r\nthe clusters to become more stable over time.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"K5BU6lB1t2nwDrZdnkalzpSZ6Wtnh+nyIA+rJcHeQEM="},"91139cd8-f278-4b67-b2a9-1f18fadf1974":{"id_":"91139cd8-f278-4b67-b2a9-1f18fadf1974","metadata":{"page_number":45,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_45","metadata":{"page_number":45,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"VlJvaD+HZfab7WkqAj/d/wpHWRHrPDvxsVt+ah1O/8Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b3e97f9f-28a4-49b0-8214-c4d47d7c401a","metadata":{"page_number":45,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"K5BU6lB1t2nwDrZdnkalzpSZ6Wtnh+nyIA+rJcHeQEM="}},"text":"Hence, we would expect\r\nthe clusters to become more stable over time. 10sklearn   MinMaxScaler:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn. preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html\r\n11sklearn      QuantileTransformershttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/\r\nsklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer.html\r\n12sklearn     DBSCAN     clusteringhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/\r\nsklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZECqalBkPNX/2vLesTKi71QF0iYkiqkbyUyo1H9cX9k="},"4eebebcf-8833-48aa-adef-8d13d4257baf":{"id_":"4eebebcf-8833-48aa-adef-8d13d4257baf","metadata":{"page_number":46,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_46","metadata":{"page_number":46,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"LkakqJQ+Dtv3qmffkh18COIEsC1t4Q4Oe+bglj96ZGQ="}},"text":"40                                                                                             CHAPTER4. METHODOLOGY\r\n4.3.2    Comparing groupings to random clusters\r\nThis is the first research to apply such methodology to sole access data. Therefore\r\nwe do not expect the clusterings resulting from this proof of concept to be perfect. Therefore we need to measure whether there is any information that can be retrieved\r\nfrom the access data with regard to consistent user classification, the AD groups\r\nor the peer groups. This shows that there is some signal in the access data with\r\nregards to the before-mentioned groups. To measure this, we compare the different\r\nscores of our clusters to that of random chance. There are two ways to go about\r\nthis:  either we extract the user amount per cluster and randomly re-distribute all\r\nusers according to this distribution, or we fully randomise the classification given the\r\nnumber of clusters. The former likely results in clusters of uneven size, the latter in\r\nevenly sized clusters.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5yU+pTMekFCGvWx3flt4hgrkUJK1CBrwugKxY7goTRE="},"72018851-1ddd-4663-8465-6933714fa12d":{"id_":"72018851-1ddd-4663-8465-6933714fa12d","metadata":{"page_number":47,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_47","metadata":{"page_number":47,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"rfcuNcmVJfGyMuKskmFBu92F2jjeVgo4s/xZOttgkEU="}},"text":"Chapter 5\r\nResults\r\nThis  section  contains  the  results  of  applying  our  clustering  methodology  both  to\r\nthe CERT dataset and within the real-world Sentinel environment.

RESULTS\r\nthis cannot be used to group users based on the resources they access. The cumu-\r\nlative difference from the mean feature was not used for clustering because of the\r\nskew it has dependant on the first day of the dataset. The access amount on the first\r\nday of the dataset sets the mean, and it takes a while for this skew to average out\r\nand for the mean number of daily accesses to reach an equilibrium. It also did not\r\ncontribute to identifying the users labelled insiders. This is most likely since the ma-\r\nlicious actions in the CERT dataset are not preceded by share discovery or lateral\r\nmovement. Because of this arbitrariness, and the unexplainability on its influence in\r\ngenerating logical clusters, we did not include this deviation feature in the clustering. Figure 5.1 shows the logon and logoff activity during different hours and days of\r\nthe week. This looks as expected: Office hours from 7:00 to roughly 21:00 and 33x\r\nas much activity during weekdays than in the weekend, or 13x as much on a daily\r\nbasis.

RESULTS\r\nApplying the same methodology using K=2 to other months resulted in the same\r\noutcome: ITAdmins and non-ITAdmins are consistently classified in a separate clus-\r\nter. There are some exceptions, which are highlighted at the end of this section. The\r\nscree plot returns that all the variance can be shown using solely PC (Principal Com-\r\nponent) 1, which is also visible in Figure 5.3, as the PC1 axis alone separates the\r\ntwo user groups. PC 1 is constructed through a combination of almost all features,\r\nthe division of which is shown in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4:Heatmap on how much every feature is used to display the two Principal\r\nComponents for the CERT dataset period 2010-04-01 until 2020-05-01. Feature importancesWe can look at what features caused the ITAdmins to be\r\nclassified in a different cluster than all other roles via the Feature Importance metrics. There are just two clusters, so the feature importances for cluster 0 are identical to\r\nthe feature importances for cluster 1, since the most influential feature causing a\r\nuser to be classified into cluster 0 is also the most influental feature causing a user\r\nto notbe classified into cluster 1. Figure 5.5 shows that the most influential features\r\nare the average number of daily accesses, the median session length and the total\r\nnumber of logons. The features differentiating the least between admins and other\r\nusers are the weekends logon,  the percentage thereof,  and the number of office\r\nhour accesses. Now that we know the feature importances we can look at the feature statistics\r\nof the clusters,  compare it with feature statistics on roles,  and verify whether the\r\nclustering is explainable. Figure 5.6 shows for the top three most influential features\r\nwhat the average, median and standard deviation is amongst the users of the two\r\ndifferent clusters.

Table 5.1 shows that\r\n8 out of 10 ITAdmin insiders get clustered differently than their role, two do not get\r\n’detected’ and none of the insiders with a role besides ITAdmin were possible to\r\nspot through this method. This is likely caused by insider ITAdmins performing little\r\nactivity after their malicious actions, causing them to access less resources than a\r\nregular ITAdmin. This phenomenon is further discussed in the Discussion chapter.

SENTINEL49\r\n5.2    Sentinel\r\nThis  part  of  the  research  was  conducted  in  the  Microsoft  Azure  Machine  Learn-\r\ning  Studio1,  a  cloud  Jupyter  notebook. We  perform  this  analysis  in  the  Sentinel\r\nenvironment using Northwave SOC customer data.Note:  Because this concerns\r\nprivacy-sensitive data, any information on user accounts and infrastructure has been\r\nanonymised. Preprocessing steps\r\nWithin Sentinel Notebook, the results of executing a query are saved in a dataframe. This process has a limit of 500.000 rows, which poses a problem when processing\r\ndata for larger organisations as they generate too many logon- and logoff Windows\r\nevents. This is because one user action is not necessarily correlated with one logon\r\nevent. Under the hood Windows can keep connecting and disconnecting to for ex-\r\nample a remote file server, causing a lot of events. This can lead to over 500.000\r\nevents on a single day alone. Therefore we reduce the granularity of the access\r\ntimes,  by summarizing all accesses with the same properties into one event per\r\nhour2. This reduces the data more than tenfold. Still, with this reduce of granularity\r\nthe largest timespan which can be queried at once is a week, instead of a month\r\nlike for the CERT dataset. In addition to removing accounts based on SID and account name, we attempted\r\nto cluster the dataset and removed outlier users which were placed in a cluster on\r\ntheir own. The purpose of this is to improve the clustering granularity for the rest of\r\nthe user-base. These accounts are consistently outliers amongst different weeks. It could not always be infered by the account name or description that they were\r\nautomated, so in reality would be worth an investigation from an analyst to identify\r\nwhy their access behaviour differs so significantly from the rest. More often than not,\r\nsuch outliers were accounts with administrator privileges as can be seen in Figure\r\n5.8, or were developer accounts. These were also commonly put in the same cluster\r\nin the iterative clustering phases, as seen in Appendix A.3.

CLUSTERING CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS57\r\n5.3    Clustering consistency improvement efforts\r\nThis section lists the different efforts put into increasing the clustering consistency\r\nand similarity to UserPeerAnalytics and AD groups.

This lead to a slight improvement\r\nin clustering stability score, as seen in Figure 5.19, but is still far from a stable clus-\r\ntering. Additionally, the comparison to AD groups score increased to an average of\r\n0.47 amongst users, and the average UserPeer score increased to 0.30.

We tested a variety of input feature compositions, such as including matching\r\nthe CERT dataset features, or only incorporating destination hosts as features, but\r\nthese only decreased the consistency scores. Of the different logontypes, the net-\r\nwork logon was observed most. This is because of the way Windows operates in\r\nthe background when connecting to another device,  as explained in Section 4.2. Therefore, not every access logged correlates to a user interaction. To try and more\r\nclosely match the CERT dataset’s structure, we filtered on the LogonType 10: RDP\r\n(Remote Desktop). With this type of logon, one user action does correlate to a single\r\nlogon event. In addition, there are significantly fewer events hence we could incor-\r\nporate the data of an entire month and include the session duration feature. RDP is\r\nalso often used by threat actors to use a compromised account for lateral movement. Therefore this behaviour could visibly change compared to a user’s regular actions. Unfortunately, filtering on RDP only decreased the cluster stability when comparing\r\nconsecutive months, as shown in Figure 5.20.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\r\nITAdmins versus other users\r\nOur clustering approach can separate users with the ITAdmin role from regular users\r\nwith ease. The main defining features for this were the average daily accesses and\r\nsession length, as Appendix A.1 reveals that ITAdmins perform more and shorter\r\nsessions. This is an inference that we could not have gotten by reading the dataset\r\ndescription, which only decribes ITAdmins having global access privileges. As shown in Table 5.1, our clustering approach works well in detecting admin insid-\r\ners as they switch clusters in the period of their insider actions. Investigation of the logon actions of ITAdmin users revealed that they perform no\r\nfurther accesses soon after their last insider actions are performed. This decreases\r\nthe ITAdmin’s number of accesses for the month they performed malicious actions\r\nin, which skews their behaviour from an ITAdmin user to a regular user. Within the\r\nscenario where the CERT Insider Threat dataset is created this implies that after\r\nsomeone  has  performed  their  malicious  actions  they  leave  the  company  straight\r\naway. This type of detection limits itself to a certain type of insider, and could also\r\ntrigger when a user is less productive than regular. The latter is not a security risk\r\nand quite invasive,  and would be regarded as a False Positive for our algorithm. Therefore, in this case, our algorithm does not detect a suspicious change in be-\r\nhaviour through a user accessingmoreresources than usual, but by a user access-\r\ninglessresources than usual. This has overlap with the research topic of Quitting\r\nDetection. Quitting detection is a subject within Insider Threat detection research\r\nwhich focuses on predicting that a user will turn against their employer. This is used\r\nin the insider threat detection research by Gavai et al. [24], who use quitting detec-\r\ntion as a proxy for insider threat detection. Therefore, our clustering approach works\r\nwell in quitting detection for ITAdmins, but only after the user has actually quit. 6.2    Real-world production environment clustering\r\nObservations\r\nDue to the problems with query limits as described in Section 5.2, we performed\r\nthe majority of the clustering using one week of data.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8L43tuWwHAF7fPho4/xmYBjjdEd+j1NxAly2wISurs4="},"9edb91ac-887e-4ce3-827e-b11ce97389bc":{"id_":"9edb91ac-887e-4ce3-827e-b11ce97389bc","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf_68","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"ueOnh2KXoGqjTiM9cbihUpOh/k8i1Aw1ai2RFnYRL2Q="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2324996d-c4df-4234-a44e-53cb798a76e6","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (1).pdf"},"hash":"8L43tuWwHAF7fPho4/xmYBjjdEd+j1NxAly2wISurs4="}},"text":"Since this is relatively short,\r\nthe feature vector values are unlikely to converge (yet) for every user, as the mean,\r\nmedian and standard deviation shift with every added day of data.

Additionally,  as we had no data on\r\nactual lateral movement or insider threats we removed this feature for the remainder\r\nof research using production data, as it did not contribute to explainable clustering. Outlier user account, or users alone in a cluster, usually proved to be service ac-\r\ncounts or admin accounts. Such clusters had a few specific hosts as most important\r\nfeature as they were the only one to log onto that resource, and logged out outside\r\nof office hours more often than other users. This fits the ITAdmin feature values ob-\r\ntained from the CERT dataset, with admin users operating outside of regular office\r\nhours more often.

No scores outside of the 0.40 - 0.47\r\nrange were observed for the entirety of the research, and most were in the 0.42 -\r\n0.45 range.

Either way, prior to using these\r\nscores as an indicator of clustering quality one should therefore research the impact\r\nthe number of clusters has on either of them. The AD groups featured several groups for users with certain administrative privi-\r\nleges. Further inspection revealed that two clusters encompassed all global domain\r\nadmins, and almost all users within admin groups. These clusters, however, also\r\ncontained a lot of non-admin users. Hence, if a user were to move to this cluster,\r\nit would not necessarily mean they displayed admin access behaviour. The few ac-\r\ncounts which were part of admin AD groups but not in one of the beforementioned\r\ntwo clusters had different characteristics to the rest, such as Job Title or Department. This could point to a misconfiguration, however deeper analysis of the situation re-\r\nquires domain knowledge of the organisation as well as their privilege and AD group\r\noverview. This type of analysis is closer to the Baaz [6] tool, and would not require\r\naccess data as input. There was one cluster with only a handful of members, where\r\nthe cluster average on the ’outside office hours accesses’ feature was significantly\r\nhigher than any other cluster.

To try and closer match the CERT dataset we filtered on\r\njust RDP connections, as these logon and logoff events are caused by human inter-\r\nactions instead of continuous background connections. This allowed re-introducing\r\nthe session-related features. The clustering plots changed, showing a clear diagonal\r\nline through the PCA plot. We did not perform further analysis on what this shape\r\nimplies on the underlying data, but the key inference is that most users are clustered\r\nclosely together. This likely causes K-means to classify many users differently over\r\ntime, leading to low similarity scores. As elaborated in the Methodology section,  one of the reasons we employ ML\r\nfor  our  feature  vectors  instead  of  static  thresholds  is  to  account  for  the  dynamic\r\nbehaviour users have. A user gets placed in a cluster relative to all other users. In\r\nthe case all other users change behaviour often according to our feature vectors,\r\nusers will be classified into different clusters often. This is the intended behaviour\r\nfor our algorithm,  but it leads to more workload for a SOC due to an increase in\r\nfalse positives and is, therefore, no added value to them. Besides this, if many users\r\nexhibit the same access behaviour,  the random factor in K-means clustering can\r\nclassify users bordering clusters differently every time. As previously discussed, the\r\nDBSCAN clustering method is not a viable alternative clustering option when aiming\r\nto monitor all users for suspicious access behaviour. We leave the option open that\r\nan alternative ML approach exists which can consistently and explainably cluster\r\nusers based on this data, but have not been able to identify such method during our\r\nresearch.

Our methodology on feature creation and the clustering thereof was tested and val-\r\nidated the CERT dataset, which yielded positive results with regards to consistency. This looked promising for real-world data inferences. However, in reality, the values\r\nof the features created are too close together to create meaningful clusters or cre-\r\nate consistent user profile groups. Creating more granularity between users would\r\nrequire either different features from the current input data.

This approach was validated using the synthetic CERT dataset, where\r\nusers were profiled consistently using mainly time and resource-based features.

Quitting detection in production would be sig-\r\nnificantly more invasive than detecting the suspicious actions themselves, both in\r\nterms of data used and type of information inferred. The validation we performed\r\non the CERT dataset in terms of insider threat detection was also related to a user\r\nquitting their job, but only after the user had performed their malicious actions.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\r\nIf parts of our approach are used in the future, it is recommended to change the\r\nclustering algorithm. The element of randomness in K-means clustering can cause\r\nusers in bordering clusters to switch continuously over time. Additionally, the grav-\r\nitational centers (centroids) tend towards larger groups. Many people sharing the\r\nsame behaviour will therefore skew the rest of the groups. In our research, every re-\r\nsource had as much influence as any other as feature in the multidimensional area,\r\nwhilst in reality some resources could be more relevant for clustering than others. This can be done according to the resource importance, or type such as file server\r\nor domain controller. That way, it is likely that one of the clusters will contain users\r\naccessing the crown jewels amongst resources, which are likely to be administra-\r\ntors. Giving weight to resources enables detecting users suddenly connecting to\r\nvital infrastructure whereas usually they did not. Combining this with other proper-\r\nties of an access event, such as using RDP for the first time to connect to a DC1, is\r\nsignificant data when keeping track of an ’anomaly score’, such as our cumulative\r\ndifference from the mean number of accesses. This also requires mapping adver-\r\nsarial actions to potential indicators in the data, the RDP connection to a DC in the\r\nbeforementioned case. In addition to resources, of the weight of any feature could\r\nof course be increased relative to less important features. Whilst we had statistics\r\nper cluster on which resources were accessed most often, this did not enable us to\r\ndraw a picture on what type of users populated a cluster. As the resources them-\r\nselves were a significant feature for the clustering, classifying the resources could\r\nshow a ’bigger picture’ of what types of resources users access, providing a better\r\npicture of a cluster’s regular behaviour.

CONCLUSION\r\nbetween many user’s values, then small deviations can lead to significantly different\r\nclusterings. This is due to the the primitive method K-means works, combined with\r\nthe randomness of the initialisation phase. How  does  our  profiling  methodology  perform  within  the  CERT\r\nv4.2 synthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups? The profiling methodology creates a clear distinction between users with the ITAd-\r\nmin role and users without. The distinctive feature values of ITAdmins show that\r\nthey perform more accesses, have shorter session durations and more accesses\r\noutside of office hours compared to other users. Other than the ITAdmins, no clear\r\nrole distinction could be made. For the K=5 value the clusters are consistent with an\r\naverage adjusted Rand score of 0.87 for consecutive months. How does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data\r\nin terms of consistency and extracted user groups? For production data our features show less separation between the users, so slight\r\nbehavioural  changes  causes  users  to  switch  clusters  often. Additionally,  the  K-\r\nmeans initialisation phase is random so users close to bordering clusters can ran-\r\ndomly switch clusters. Increasing the timespan over which the features are created\r\nhas a slight positive effect on the consistency, but stays at an adjusted Rand score\r\nof 0.41 for consecutive periods. Hence,  the consistency does not come close to\r\nthe one achieved for the synthetic CERT dataset and cannot be used in practice for\r\nidentifying suspicious access behaviour. There is a mediocre similarity between our extracted clusters, AD groups and Mi-\r\ncrosoft UEBA’s UserPeerAnalytics. The scores for our custom performance metrics\r\ndo not come close to the hypothetical maximum of 1.0, but are consistently better\r\ncompared to users being classified into clusters at random. This implies there is a\r\nsignal in the data, but via our methodology does not lead to usable results. Is it possible to profile users consistently using explainable clus-\r\ntering and non-invasive data sources available to a Security Op-\r\nerations Center? We used logon events to create privacy-preserving feature vectors for every user,\r\nbased on literature research and threat intelligence.

This is likely due quitting after the malicious\r\nactions have taken place. For real-world data, we conclude that there is not enough granularity between these\r\nfeatures to consistently profile users. Through this methodology, it is not possible\r\nto determine deviating behaviour accurately using solely logon data. Profiling users\r\nconsistently using explainable clustering requires at least different pre-processing\r\nto bring more granularity to the available data. The exact insider threat or account\r\ncompromise actions should be determined beforehand to tailor to an adversarial in-\r\ndicator. More invasive data is likely required to differ between users, as was used by\r\nsimilar research to achieve higher insider threat and account compromise detection\r\nscores. To summarise, we converted non-invasive access logs into a feature vector per user. We applied K-means clustering to these feature vectors and compared the formed\r\nclusters with known user groups. We also compared clusters of different periods in\r\ntime to each other. Whilst for a synthetical dataset this yielded promising results,\r\nin production data we could not get useful inferences from the resulting clusters. It\r\nwas also not possible to construct consistent user profiles over time, since we were\r\nunable to separate users clearly on their access behaviour. Therefore it could not\r\nbe used by a SOC to detect suspicious deviations in user access behaviour. Because of these findings, the Northwave SOC is looking into how they can include\r\nother types of data to achieve more granularity between users.

A Security Operations Center (SOC) monitors a company’s digi-\r\ntal infrastructure to protect against these threats by detecting suspicious events and\r\ntaking mitigating action. Adversaries commonly need to access resources illegiti-\r\nmately to achieve action upon their objectives, and do so via existing user accounts. We develop a method to identify suspicious access behaviour using non-intrusive\r\ndata available to a SOC. For every user, a feature vector is constructed describing\r\ntheir access behaviour. This vector contains statistics over a predefined period of\r\ntime onwhat resourcesa user accessed atwhat timeand inwhat manner. We sur-\r\nvey different Machine Learning profiling possibilities and select the general-purpose\r\nK-means clustering to group users with similar behavioural characteristics. We apply this method to the Insider Threat logs from the Carnegie Mellon Uni-\r\nversity Software Engineering Institute, a synthetic dataset which is a benchmark for\r\ninsider threat detection research. Through access behaviour profiling, we were able\r\nto identify all users with the ITAdmin role. The consistency of clusters for benign\r\nusers over time was compared and quantified through the Adjusted Rand metric. Comparing consecutive months,  this resulted in an average consistency score of\r\n0.87. We were able to detect 80% of insider threats with the ITAdmin role by moni-\r\ntoring for changes in their cluster over time. Applying the same methodology to access data of real-world organisations al-\r\nlows for significantly less consistent clustering, with average consecutive month con-\r\nsistency scores of 0.41. We observe a slight similarity between our clusters and the\r\ngroupings within the organisation’s Active Directory. The clusters also show slight\r\nsimilarity with the groups inferred by Microsoft User Entity Behaviour and Analytics\r\nvia Machine Learning. We show how the granularity of the most relevant features\r\nof the synthetic dataset differs from that of real-world data, which is suspected to\r\ncause this decrease in clustering consistency. To  be  able  to  detect  suspicious  changes  in  user  access  behaviour  a  consis-\r\ntent profiling method is required. Our privacy-preserving, general-purpose profiling\r\nmethodology enabled consistent results on the synthetic dataset.

access digital resources illegitimately is a part of almost every successful\r\ncyber attack. This research creates a method to profile users based on their access\r\nbehaviour using the data from a Security Operations Center (SOC). Having accu-\r\nrate user access profiles allows for detecting suspicious deviations in this behaviour,\r\nwhich  can  be  used  to  alert  a  SOC  analyst  to  take  a  closer  look  at  an  account’s\r\nactivity and determine whether the accesses could be malicious. One of the good practices regarding cyber security is the least privilege principle. If a user does not need to access a particular resource for their regular responsibil-\r\nities, their account should not have access to this resource. This is an example of\r\naccess control, which takes effort to keep track of and maintain over time. For exam-\r\nple, if someone leaves a the company, their accesses should be revoked. In reality,\r\nthis is often not done correctly [1], causing accounts to have more privileges than\r\nrequired. This becomes a problem when an adversary manages to gain control of\r\nthis account, known as account compromise, or when a user turns against their em-\r\nployer, called an insider threat. If a domain admin account gets compromised with\r\nall the access rights they possess, it will pose a security risk even when adhering\r\nto the least privilege principle. Therefore it is crucial to not only survey the access\r\ncontrol policies but also consider the actual accesses an account performs to detect\r\nsuspicious activity, which is where a SOC comes into play. The goal of a SOC is to detect suspicious events within an organisation’s digital\r\ninfrastructure. Multiple data sources can be used for detection,  such as sensors\r\nwithin the network to capture traffic, logs of servers and logs of end-point devices. A\r\nSecurity Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is used to combine and\r\ncorrelate this data.

INTRODUCTION\r\ndetection causes manual labour for an analyst to verify the detection’s legitimacy, it\r\nis a SOC’s goal to finetune its detection rules. The detections should trigger on as\r\nmany security risks as possible, this is called a True Positive. The other possibilities\r\ninclude events without actual risk, called False Positives, from which we want as few\r\nas possible. Additionally, the rate of actual security threats going undetected, called\r\nFalse Negatives, should naturally be as close to zero as possible. The digital infrastructure of an organisation usually contains ‘crown jewels’, which\r\nare  their  most  valuable  assets. These  can  be  on-premise  servers  such  as  file\r\nservers, Domain Controllers (DCs) and mail exchange servers. DCs host a domain’s\r\nActive Directory (AD), which imposes user and device policies. A compromise of the\r\nDC can lead to malicious policies being executed on all of an organisation’s domain-\r\njoined devices, such as employee laptops. A file server usually contains much of\r\nan organisation’s confidential data, which should only be accessed by those with a\r\nlegitimate reason. Because we use access as an indicator for potentially malicious\r\nbehaviour,  these resource types are our main points of focus. The input data in\r\nthis research is limited to access events within the Windows Event log to remain\r\nas little invasive on user’s behavioural data as possible, whilst being able to make\r\ninferences on suspicious accounts. When behavioural monitoring raises an alert\r\nfor the SOC, the alert needs to clarifywhya certain user account was marked as\r\nsuspicious to assist the analyst in their further investigation. This reasoning is also\r\na requirement from ethical perspective,  as it is impermissible to have an opaque\r\nalgorithm labelling users for suspicion. This process needs to be as transparent and\r\nexplainable as possible. Detection rules within a SIEM describe when to raise an alert, based on log en-\r\ntries. An alert is a suspicious activity that a SOC analyst looks into to determine\r\nits legitimacy and takes action upon if it is suspected to be malicious. Frequently,\r\nsuch rules are static in determining suspicious events. However, this poses a prob-\r\nlem when creating a profile based on behaviour, as this is a dynamic characteristic.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"xnBI6mouVj6D4sMTsDQBpS1fcWjiqddKF8Iiy6xFZls="},"70faf4d7-757a-4f17-b0c9-f3393c4efc4d":{"id_":"70faf4d7-757a-4f17-b0c9-f3393c4efc4d","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"1FtiM2gnBscBoQ1qDiEBpmQmdwxJ+Y8fWhtbkLiHPVo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d344d765-62c4-48d5-8f74-6b8899ad8a8e","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"xnBI6mouVj6D4sMTsDQBpS1fcWjiqddKF8Iiy6xFZls="}},"text":"Therefore, this research aims to develop a novel methodology using existing meth-\r\nods to create user behavioural profiles from access logs and be able to detect sus-\r\npicious deviations from this profile over time, by using non-invasive data available to\r\na SOC.

To answer this question and guide this research, we need to answer the following\r\nsub-questions:\r\n1.Which non-invasive features readily available to a SOC are relevant in\r\ndescribing user access behaviour? Using both related literature and threat intelligence, we infer relevant features\r\nto keep track of regarding access behaviour. 2.Which explainable machine learning method can be used to profile users? Of the available Machine Learning methods, we choose one which fits our pur-\r\npose as explainable, simple and genericly applicable approach. 3.How does our profiling methodology perform within the CERT v4.2 syn-\r\nthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups? The  CERT  Insider  Threat  dataset  contains  data  on  every  user’s  role  within\r\nthe artificial company and spans a large period. Therefore we can compare\r\nour clusters to these role groups and measure how stable the clusters are for\r\nbenign users over time. 4.How does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data in terms\r\nof consistency and extracted user groups? We profile users by applying our methodology to login data available to a SOC\r\nand measure how stable the clustering is over time.

First,  we\r\ndescribe the data available to a SOC which can be used to reach our objective. Second,  the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) processes and\r\npossibilities are explained. Finally, we highlight the Data Science fundamentals re-\r\nquired to understand the methodology of this research. 2.1    SOC Access Data\r\nA SOC has several methods of monitoring digital infrastructure. By inserting sen-\r\nsors  into  the  network,  traffic  can  be  captured  to  detect  which  hosts  interact  with\r\neach other and possibly inspect the payload. Server logs are very useful, as these\r\nare central parts of the infrastructure with which many users directly or indirectly\r\ninteract. Organisations generally use a domain to manage their devices. A domain\r\nis a group of computers within a network administered by a central server, the Do-\r\nmain Controller (DC). Accounts within the domain can log onto every device they are\r\nauthorised to, using their domain account and password. Domain accounts authen-\r\nticate against the DC to log onto such devices and resources. There are multiple\r\ntypes of authentication, which are some of the events the SOC can monitor to de-\r\ntermine a user’s access behaviour. In addition to servers and networks, endpoint\r\ndevices such as employee laptops or phones can be monitored, as these types of\r\ndevices can provide access to company resources. Each of the above-mentioned devices generates logs. To correlate these different\r\ndata sources and analyse them, logs are sent to a Security Information and Event\r\nManagement (SIEM) system. The SIEM solution used for the real-world scenario\r\npart of this research is Sentinel1, a cloud service by Microsoft.

BACKGROUND\r\nsend a subset of their Windows Events logs2  3to this SIEM for analysis. To access a resource, a user must first authenticate to prove they are authorised. In the Windows domain this is commonly performed via the default protocol Kerberos\r\n[3], which uses tickets distributed by the DC, or the fall-back NTLM4, a challenge-\r\nresponse mechanism. When a user accesses a resource after valid authentication,\r\nWindows Event 4624 is logged:An account was successfully logged on. This event\r\ncontains, amongst others, information on the time, user, target host, authentication\r\ntype, connection method and source IP. If a user logs off, this generates events 4634\r\nor 4647, which include similar information. 2.2    Microsoft Sentinel\r\nThe  real-world  data  part  of  this  research  is  performed  using  the  Microsoft  Sen-\r\ntinel SIEM5. Sentinel is a cloud solution that,  among others,  can be used to in-\r\ngest logs from endpoint devices. The data is saved in tables and queried using\r\nthe Kusto  Query Language (KQL). The tables  used for this  research include the\r\nSecurityEventtable, which contains the ingested Windows Events. Azure Active\r\nDirectory (AAD) is an identity and access management tool organisations can use\r\nto sign into apps using Single Sign-On (SSO). Suppose the on-premise AD is syn-\r\nchronised with the Azure Active Directory. In that case, it is possible to correlate\r\nthe on-premise accounts with cloud accounts and perform further analyses using\r\nUser and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA)6. This produces two additional tables:\r\nIdentityInfoandUserPeerAnalytics. IdentityInfo displays a combination of on-\r\npremise and cloud properties of an account. UserPeerAnalytics provides a list of\r\nup to 20 ranked peers for any AAD account, generated using Microsoft’s machine-\r\nlearning algorithm applied to all of its connected data sources. Since the peer ana-\r\nlytics table is based on cloud accounts and our analysis is performed by monitoring\r\non-premise accesses, the accounts need to be correlated using the IdentityInfo table\r\nas shown in Figure 2.1.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZbqTbALocT3diRBWTP6PJH5Ltm9kGVG6g/K5CRz1W8c="},"344b46e6-376f-4c2f-883a-6a354fb1883a":{"id_":"344b46e6-376f-4c2f-883a-6a354fb1883a","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"cY0BdaxLvRUUb+7a3JvSg9UV6JTOaGT/iCdAAR1o5is="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5ff434d2-88ff-4233-9e65-47d62f398597","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"ZbqTbALocT3diRBWTP6PJH5Ltm9kGVG6g/K5CRz1W8c="}},"text":"2Windows      Event      list:https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/\r\nencyclopedia/\r\n3Windows  Events  sent  to  a  SIEM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/\r\nwindows-security-event-id-reference\r\n4NTLM:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm\r\n5Microsoft Sentinel:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview\r\n6Sentinel UEBA:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ueba-reference","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YkAoJmIiNYrqMm0B16Lj0civjVxvZmAMfBFGPgqWPZY="},"4ba79b6e-cc4e-48c0-accc-b9a8ddbbe3c6":{"id_":"4ba79b6e-cc4e-48c0-accc-b9a8ddbbe3c6","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"7u9wwHz18A+/e5XHtk9HiAcK+kZN+YGVNfSvNyyr8bU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"33ab2bec-bc59-4f8d-90f7-03653a841644","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"PkojeP+q1SLFHpTN6ofbcxaAM1lXzp7YFR7aBizZd0Q="}},"text":"2.3.

The way we\r\napply these methods are further discussed in the methodology section. K-means clustering\r\nThis  section  describes  the  clustering  approach,  a  choice  which  is  further  moti-\r\nvated in Section 3.5. There are different possibilities for clustering points in a multi-\r\ndimensional area. In our case of user clustering, every point represents a user and\r\na  feature  vector  is  a  list  of  numerical  properties  describing  the  user’s  behaviour. Every feature within a user’s feature vector is translated to a dimension within the\r\nmultidimensional area. K-Means aims to partition objects in this multi-dimensional\r\nspace intonclusters. This is achieved by minimising the ’Within-Cluster Sum of\r\nSquares’ and maximising the ’Between-Cluster Sum of Squares’.The naive version\r\nof the algorithm uses the following steps, which are further illustrated by Figure 2.2:\r\n•Step 1:Initialisationselectnrandom points in multi-dimensional space to be\r\nthe initial ’centroid’\r\n•Step 2:InitialisationAssociate each point to its closest ’centroid’\r\n•Step 3:Compute the gravitational centre, the centroid, for each label\r\n•Step 4:Associate each point with their closest centroid\r\n•Step 5:Repeat from step 3 until convergence, or halt if the centroids do not\r\nmove anymore.

(Adjusted) Rand index\r\nA metric is required to measure how similar the clusters from different periods in time\r\nare. For this, we compare how users are divided amongst the clusters for different\r\niterations of the algorithm. This is not as trivial as counting the number of users\r\nclassified into different clusters, as the number of users designated to a cluster can\r\nchange. For  this,  we  apply  the  adjusted  Rand  index7,  a  function  measuring  the\r\nsimilarity of two separate cluster divisions. This metric was initially developed by\r\nRand [4], but because of the underlying formula, it often returns a value close to 1\r\nwhen comparing different sets of labels. The Rand index method was later optimised\r\nby Hubert et al. [5] to compensate for this factor of chance. We therefore apply the\r\nadjusted Rand score in this research.

First,  we\r\nsurvey the literature about the threats of improper user access control and detection\r\npossibilities. Then,  we look at anomaly detection mechanisms based on access\r\nlogs. Finally, we visit the work benchmarking their anomaly detection algorithms on\r\nthe synthetic CERT Insider Threat dataset. 3.1    Access Control\r\nFor a user account to access a resource, they require the appropriate permissions. Within an organisation’s digital infrastructure, this is usually arranged via Active Di-\r\nrectory groups. A group can be granted read and write rights to a resource. If a user\r\nis a member of this group, they inherit all these rights. Managing such accesses\r\nfor users and groups is calledAccess control. The Principle of Least Privilege is\r\na concept within information security which describes that users should only have\r\naccess to the resources they need. Not adhering to this principle forms a security\r\nrisk if an adversary manages to control an account, such as in the case of account\r\ncompromise or insider threats. Research has tried to detect misconfigurations in such policies using different\r\napproaches. Das et al. [6] created Baaz: a tool that represents access control poli-\r\ncies  as  a  matrix,  which  for  every  user  (column)  and  every  resource  (row)  states\r\nwhether access is granted. If a reference dataset exists on which resources every\r\nrole should be able to access,  users can be mapped to a role group with similar\r\nrights. The resources that share the same policies are clustered if no reference\r\nmatrix is available. From this, clusters of users with roughly the same access per-\r\nmissions can be produced. After the clustering step, users and resources which do\r\nnot fit into any cluster are marked as outliers. In this case,  anOutliercan imply\r\nusers with too many permissions, a security issue, and users who have too few per-\r\n11","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Y21HGpyZQwe/hctmaguvFfu6KiO/RuZbudlquG3ny+4="},"db3c7b59-c669-4d83-9e8f-eb5e361a612c":{"id_":"db3c7b59-c669-4d83-9e8f-eb5e361a612c","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"vMcrms0+tirda8qy46M5z2XMBgQkUQKoK1aIUPKHSp4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"faaa8cb8-0e62-4ff6-a0d6-b556fe722506","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"Y4IRBAnsDc/4sGBDROAJ54byZLTRR5gov1xNzQIXVNc="}},"text":"12                                                                                             CHAPTER3.

The detection of accessibility issues is, to us, not\r\na goal in itself, but repeated access requests through misconfigurations could lead\r\nto  administrators  becoming  too  generous  in  granting  access  permissions,  hence\r\nleading to security issues again. In reality,  such well-documented access control\r\nmatrices or even a reference dataset on roles and resources are often not available. Therefore is more realistic to perform analyses on logs. Bauer et al. [7] performed\r\nlog analysis to analyse the access attempts foraccessibilityproblems. They used\r\nassociation rule mining [8], a type of inference that tries to predict future accesses\r\nthrough previous ones. Because such rules can repeatedly produce the same false\r\nassociation, a feedback mechanism was introduced to prevent these mistakes from\r\nreoccurring. However, since such labelling is performed manually, when applied on\r\na larger scale it becomes labour-intensive, which is undesirable to a SOC. 3.2    Relational database user profiling through access\r\nlogs\r\nOne of the goals of profiling users through access logs is to detect deviations from\r\nthe norm. This is a use case foranomaly detection, for example, when someone\r\nsuddenly changes behaviour to access more resources than usual or logs in outside\r\nof office hours. The research area of user profiling and anomaly detection using logs is more\r\nmature within the field of relational databases. Even though this is a specific type\r\nof resource access, their methodologies are still relevant when considering broader\r\nresource types. Kamra et al. [9] mined SQL queries from the database audit logs,\r\ncreating profiles to model normal database access behaviour. These profiles consist\r\nofquiplets, extracting different fields from the SQL query to determine what data is\r\nqueried, such as tables, columns and constraints. To train their model, outliers were\r\nremoved,  under the assumption that the leftover queries were benign. Similar to\r\nBauer [7], they used two scenarios:  role-based and unsupervised. For the former,\r\nthe role was available for every user executing query, and the Naive Bayes Clas-\r\nsifier1was used to produce the probability that a user with this role would indeed\r\nexecute such a query. The unsupervised scenario is approached as a clustering\r\nproblem.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iLyAFLNFm+Xwp/aibBPH0oV+HB4EQGZOY2FMb7t6ofc="},"faaa8cb8-0e62-4ff6-a0d6-b556fe722506":{"id_":"faaa8cb8-0e62-4ff6-a0d6-b556fe722506","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_18","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"vMcrms0+tirda8qy46M5z2XMBgQkUQKoK1aIUPKHSp4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"db3c7b59-c669-4d83-9e8f-eb5e361a612c","metadata":{"page_number":18,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"iLyAFLNFm+Xwp/aibBPH0oV+HB4EQGZOY2FMb7t6ofc="}},"text":"The unsupervised scenario is approached as a clustering\r\nproblem.

The research compares the different monitoring elements by\r\nplacing a different person than the authenticated account in front of the computer,\r\nhaving them perform exercises and testing how long it takes for every element to\r\nmark the user’s behaviour as anomalous. The keystrokes and viewed sites features\r\nrecognised anomalous behaviour the quickest, but a weighted combination of all fea-\r\ntures performed the best. For access behaviour, a similar approach could be used\r\nby converting every feature into a numerical value, giving weight to every feature,\r\nand testing against the historical profile whether there is a statistical difference. If\r\nthere is a difference, its weight score gets added to the cumulative anomaly score\r\nevery interval. The session is marked as anomalous if the anomaly score crosses a\r\nthreshold. Wang et al. [12] analysed user behaviour through characteristics similar to those\r\nused  by  Pannell  [11]. As  they  only  test  on  labelled  datasets,  a  supervised  ML\r\napproach is possible through the use of Support Vector Machines. Their dataset\r\nincludes biometric information, and they found that this characteristic worked well\r\nin profiling the correct individual and identifying whether the authenticated account\r\nbelongs to the user behind the computer interactions. However, their testing setup\r\nallows for making assumptions on legitimate training data without anomalies and re-\r\nquires detailed datasets on user-computer interactions. Thus, the nature of this data\r\nand training assumptions make it infeasible to apply their method within a SOC. When teaching an algorithm to distinguish between different users in audit sessions,\r\nif users share many behavioural traits, this causes many false positives. This issue\r\nwas recognised by Garchery et al. [13], who went on to group similar individual users\r\ninto clusters and found this led to better overall performance. Their approach to user\r\nrepresentation and clustering is confusion matrices with actual and predicted users\r\non the different axes. The main difference with regular unsupervised anomaly detec-\r\ntion is that they start with a supervised dataset with identified user sessions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"k2YkRWmoxYh0pacCRjj/CJuGywyf99z+RifYq1inDQ4="},"3bc92513-2e78-43bd-89c3-610400deec61":{"id_":"3bc92513-2e78-43bd-89c3-610400deec61","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_20","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"Zoq/oVxmKfe+eTQb/Hz6yO5E9YSE9LKGYQYQf+ylr5U="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d035f907-65d0-4970-9afc-c6770d1c4d9c","metadata":{"page_number":20,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"k2YkRWmoxYh0pacCRjj/CJuGywyf99z+RifYq1inDQ4="}},"text":"It is then\r\nconverted into an unsupervised method through the clustering of similar-behaving\r\nusers.

GMMs allow for a mixture of probability distributions, which is helpful for mon-\r\nitoring behaviour as this can change slowly over time. Their solution has a feedback\r\nloop through analysts to improve detection, as the analysts’ input is a labelled obser-\r\nvation. A GMM per employee is created, and the decision-making process is visually\r\nrepresented to get insight into which factors lead to the detection of the anomaly be-\r\ning triggered. Role information can also be included, as different roles may have\r\ndifferent suspicious behaviour, such as the sales department mailing many files to\r\npeople outside the company. Although quite useful, their approach with the sensi-\r\ntivity profiles is very intrusive, so generally not applicable within a SOC. The analyst\r\nfeedback loop could work well in practice to reduce false positives,  although this\r\nwould require significant manual labour. Their ML is unsupervised and can include\r\nrole information, so it could be helpful for comparing the user themselves to the rest\r\nof their role group.

Those\r\n’distance scores’ are used to create a feature vector per user, and those features\r\ncan be used to identify users and detect anomalies if a threshold is crossed.

Another\r\nexample is the shortest path between two URLs:  how many hyperlinks it takes to\r\nget from one internet page to the other. The core of this detection mechanism is that\r\nthere needs to be a numerical distance to express similarity between two accesses,\r\nwhich is hard to apply within our access type without significant domain knowledge\r\nof the network and occupations. This approach is likely not suitable for our research. We have seen so far that related work can perform proper detection of malicious\r\nactivity on user accounts, but mainly by profiling the user interaction with the com-\r\nputer itself, contrary to just the access properties.

Sharma recognises that it is harder to find a trade-off between false positives and\r\nmissing anomalies when using fixed time windows to extract features. It is hard to\r\ndetect an anomaly for short windows, whilst for large windows, the behaviour could\r\nbecome too generic. Therefore, the model takes all events within one session as\r\nfeature vector input, which comprises 44 features. These events include numerical\r\nfeatures such as to how many devices a connection was made or how many job\r\nsearching websites were visited and categorical features such as the role or func-\r\ntional unit.

Realising this effectivity per type\r\nof threat scenario and the importance of different features is very useful to realise\r\nwhat input data is relevant and what types of threats still go undetected. After ap-\r\nplying supervised ML approaches,  the same authors performed an unsupervised\r\nlearning-based anomaly detection approach for insider threat detection [23]. They\r\napplied four methods: Auto-encoders, Isolation Forest, Lightweight On-line detection\r\nof anomalies, and Local Outlier Factor. Additionally, they varied the representation\r\nof temporal information within data, optimising how behavioural changes over time\r\nare detected. Variations include concatenating feature vectors from a specific time-\r\nframe, explicitly adding the percentile, or the difference between a number and its\r\nmean or median, to the feature vector. Every CERT version dataset has a differ-\r\nent organisational structure and scenarios. They looked into their model’s generic\r\napplicability and robustness for different datasets by training on one CERT dataset\r\nversion and applying it to another. Finally, applying multiple algorithms allows vot-\r\ning:  An event is only marked as anomalous if the number of algorithms marking it\r\nanomalous crosses a threshold.

Pannell et al. keep track of a user by counting specific actions, also referred\r\nto asfrequency feature,  over a session of 30 seconds,  such as keystroke analy-\r\nsis and the amount of running applications. For access behaviour, other elements\r\ncould be kept track of and counted in a time interval, such as the different destination\r\nhosts, authentication methods and logon types. Sharma et al. used a session-based\r\napproach instead of a predefined timeframe. They kept track of, amongst others,\r\nwhether a logon was during working hours, the day of the week and the logon until\r\nlogoff session duration. User activities were tracked by Tuor et al. by counting them\r\nin a 24-hour time window. For every action taken by the user a value was increased,\r\nbased on a decision tree, such as a separate counter for a logon action between 12\r\nam and 6 am. Le et al. found that for frequency features, the session-based and 24-\r\nhour time windows data worked best. In addition to frequency features, they used\r\nstatistical features:  descriptive statistics such as the mean, median and standard\r\ndeviation of properties related to user actions. From this, as they kept track of all\r\nactivity within the session, too, we infer that the daily frequency features will suit our\r\napproach best. Within the CERT dataset, linking the temporal dependencies is es-\r\nsential. When someone logs in on a deviating hour, opens a cloud storage website,\r\nplugs in a USB and starts uploading, the sequence of events makes it an apparent\r\nanomaly of, for example, espionage attempting to exfiltrate company secrets. Single\r\nlog entries are likely not enough to detect deviating behaviour. It needs to be seen\r\nin context, hence we also need to add features using data from previous intervals to\r\ntrack changes over time. In addition to considering what worked well for similar research, we use threat\r\nintelligence to infer what behavioural change relates to suspicious behaviour.

This is\r\nlikely because otherwise, it might interfere with the actual user’s session, who will\r\nget alerted. Additionally, operating outside of office hours is likely to delay a reaction\r\nfrom the victim’s side. The profiling of user behaviour and detection of its deviations is tackled in dif-\r\nferent ways in the literature. The two main ways of processing the feature vectors\r\nto profile user behaviour are via statistical tests or ML. Statistical tests allow for a\r\nsimple method of giving different weights to vectors. On the other hand, ML is more\r\nwidely used by related work and has yielded better results. Most often, a type of\r\nanomaly  detection  was  used  to  detect  insider  threats  or  compromised  accounts,\r\nranging from, e.g. LSTM Auto-encoders to Gaussian Mixed Models. Applying such\r\na mechanism is out of scope for this research, as it would require further research\r\non  which  types  of  anomaly  detection  are  suitable  for  CERT  and  production  data\r\nand how they work under the hood. Anomaly detection is possible in both a su-\r\npervised and unsupervised manner. However, the supervised version is generally\r\nonly suitable when ground truth is available on, for example, insiders or user roles. Before able to detect anomalies, we need to be able to profile users meaningfully\r\nand consistently over time. For that, we focus on clustering to develop this profiling\r\nmethodology. K-means clustering\r\nThere  are  several  methods  readily  available  to  use  in  python  libraries,  such  as\r\nsklearn4. We  do  not  survey  all  of  them,  but  choose  an  explainable  one  to  test\r\nour research on. The explainability is important because of its intended use for real-\r\nworld data involving humans,  it is impermissable for an algorithm to mark a user\r\nas suspicious without a transparent reasoning behind it. The reason for choosing\r\nK-means as a clustering method is threefold.

Therefore we decided to\r\nuse the general-purpose, straightforward K-means clustering algorithm, which solely\r\nrequires the desired amount of clusters as input parameters, which can be gener-\r\nated using the Elbow heuristic. The main drawback of this algorithm is that it does\r\nnot perform very well on clusters of different sizes. This could, in future research, be\r\nsolved by profiling the feature vectors before clustering and selecting the clustering\r\napproach based on this, but discovering the perfect clustering algorithm falls outside\r\nof the scope of this research. Access log data used\r\nThere are multiple stages where it is possible to monitor user access behaviour. During authentication via Kerberos,  when a user authenticates against the DC a\r\nWindows Event describes what type of service a TGS (Ticket Granting Server) had\r\nbeen requested for. Then a user logs onto the host and performs actions on this\r\ndevice. Our goal is to detect it when a user suspiciously changes access behaviour\r\nfrom their regular profile. We want this detection to be as generally applicable as\r\npossible. Logged authentication events are hard to correlate because TGSs are\r\ncommonly not sent to the SIEM and authentication tokens are valid for en extended\r\nperiod of time, making monitoring difficult for, e.g. outside office hour activity. We\r\nalso need to decide which devices we can use the logs from. Logs from endpoint de-\r\nvices such as employee laptops generate many events. Since there are many such\r\ndevices, a SIEM would be flooded with data if they were all onboarded to the SIEM. Therefore, these endpoint devices are commonly not onboarded, making them hard\r\nto monitor. As previously mentioned, servers are among the most valuable assets\r\nwithin an organisation, so we will limit our monitoring to those servers. Additionally,\r\nmany employee devices will need to connect to such servers to access domain-\r\nwide resources. Therefore we limit our focus to the actual logon event (4624) onto\r\nservers,  as this allows us to observewhich accountconnected towhich hostat\r\nwhich timeandhow.

This is not in line with what we expect\r\nfrom the real-world scenario with likely many fileservers and printers as accessed\r\ndevices,  and makes it harder to cluster based on user’s overlap regarding which\r\nPC’s they access. Therefore for this dataset we focus on the temporal aspects of\r\nthe accesses. 2) Feature engineering\r\nTo create feature vectors we need to look at more than just how many times a user\r\naccessed a certain PC, especially because for this dataset there are only few re-\r\nsources shared amongst many people. Section 3.5 describes why these features\r\nare relevant for monitoring access behaviour. The features are elaborated below\r\nand the overview is shown later in Table 4.1\r\nUnique accessesTheuniqaccessesparameter counts how many different PC’s\r\na user has accessed. Using this, we can filter out users who have only accessed\r\n< Nmachines from our analysis. Too many users with identical access behaviour\r\nskews the K-means clustering method, as there will be large number of users with\r\nthe same feature vector. This causes a huge ’gravitational center’, meaning most\r\ncentroids will move towards this user group. This lowers the granularity to which\r\nother users can be classified into clusters. Additionally, such users are less suspi-\r\ncious when ignoring the significance of certain machines. They have too few data\r\npoints for our profiling methodology, as we can only incorporate temporal behaviour\r\nand nothing with regards towhichresources were accessed to match their behaviour\r\nwith that of their peers. Timeframe parameterWe introduce thetimeframeparameter, used to define the\r\ngranularity of features. Using this, we divide the total duration of the log data into\r\nthese  shorter  timeframe  lengths  and  count  how  many  accesses  (logons)  a  user\r\nperformed within that timeframe. If the timeframe is increased to one week instead of\r\none day, there will be less and more generic feature vectors per user. If we decrease\r\nthe timeframe to 1 hour, every user will have many more statistical feature vectors\r\nper timeframe, which values deviate a lot.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2/hdrU1XbeUGiPbwj9NSI8CzW/yUPBGMp704hDrYIOg="},"bf8dca5f-114b-4699-aa74-713436b50c81":{"id_":"bf8dca5f-114b-4699-aa74-713436b50c81","metadata":{"page_number":31,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_31","metadata":{"page_number":31,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"i5CDGYSKMbXQNupqqnm0j90LcFZqkJ8sqhEse7ehsb4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"822e6b37-254d-49f7-9246-74d5a59c9437","metadata":{"page_number":31,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"2/hdrU1XbeUGiPbwj9NSI8CzW/yUPBGMp704hDrYIOg="}},"text":"This value is for now is set to 24 hours,\r\nbased on similar research [21] [22].

METHODOLOGY\r\nOffice HoursAnother important characteristic within logon data is whether a logon\r\ntook place during or outside of office hours [18]. A user accessing more resources\r\noutside of office hours than regular could be indication for an account compromise. Therefore for every timeframe, we calculate how many of the logins were outside of\r\noffice hours. For weekdays this is defined as before 7:00 or after 21:00, as based on\r\n5.1. A weekend access is always outside of office hours. From these features per\r\ntimeframe we also calculate the mean, median and standard deviation as statistical\r\nfeatures. The same features per timeframe and corresponding statistical features\r\nare computed for accesseswithinoffice hours. Novel accessesPer timeframe, we count how many of the resources were ac-\r\ncessed for the first time:newlyaccessedresourceamtintimeframeyyyymmdd. This is important to profile an account used for network discovery or propagation. Such behaviour will make many accesses for the first time, ones which the legiti-\r\nmate user or the person whilst they were still acting benign had the rights to but\r\nnever previously accessed. As with the above features, the mean, median and stan-\r\ndard deviation statistical features are computed. Cumulative  difference  from  the  meanTo  find  patterns  in  changing  behaviour\r\nover time,  we introduce a new feature:  thecumulative difference from mean ac-\r\ncesses until timeframe X. This feature is used to keep track of trends over time,\r\nsuch as a user continuing to access more resources over time. This feature can be\r\ncompared to the Cumulative Sum control chart (CUSUM). The CUSUM is a method\r\nto monitor change: A temporal sequence of values is standardised and compared to\r\nthe expected value. If the difference is larger than a pre-defined parameter (e.g., half\r\na standard deviation), it gets added to the running cumulative deviation sum. There\r\nare separate running sums for both positive or negative changes in value. This is\r\nmost likely not applicable to our case with daily accesses. Here our ’expected value’\r\nis the average value up until a given timeframe, and any timeframe where a person\r\ndoes not access any resources (e.g., weekends or vacation days) would cause a\r\nsignificant negative deviation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"m2Qg3ChYICKh2m0gcsaZpLswod7EJv7yomwKMtkRh9Q="},"d4d1443d-502d-419f-97b8-5724fdf9a209":{"id_":"d4d1443d-502d-419f-97b8-5724fdf9a209","metadata":{"page_number":32,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_32","metadata":{"page_number":32,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"g4F7/SV1Rj6fS/v+pINHLGjI8vENRhtMuMbFlYy8UM4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"08668fcb-1da3-4058-8fab-6a8e52058499","metadata":{"page_number":32,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"m2Qg3ChYICKh2m0gcsaZpLswod7EJv7yomwKMtkRh9Q="}},"text":"This lowers the mean and causes the next working\r\nday to be a significant positive deviation et cetera.

This is performed whilst retaining as much information as possible. We aim for two\r\nresulting components, to be able to display the results in a 2D plot. It is important\r\nto note that PCA is not the same concept as computing feature importance and\r\nremoving the least valuable feature. The latter inevitably leads to information loss. PCA tries to express a combination of features in a newcomponent, by inputting a\r\ncertain percentage of every feature. An example of this for the first PCA dimension\r\n(PCA 1) and the second PCA dimension (PCA 2) is shown in Figure 4.3. Since variance is information, the first coordinate (principal component) captures\r\nthe greatest variance, the second coordinate captures the second greatest variance\r\net cetera. A scree plot shows how much variation every component captures from\r\nthe feature vectors. From the scree plot in Figure 4.4 we can see that in this example\r\n80% of variance can be explained via just two principal components, which makes\r\nit suitable to display in 2D using PCA 1 and PCA 2. 7) Compute feature importance per cluster\r\nWe apply the ’unsupervised to supervised’ method as described in Section 2.3 to\r\nproduce  an  ranked  list  of  features  based  on  influence,  per  cluster. The  highest\r\nranked feature is the one which is most distinctive for that cluster and had the largest\r\neffect on users to be clustered together.

Therefore, per cluster, we compute the\r\nmean, median and standard deviation of every feature. Using the Role information\r\nfrom the CERT dataset, we compute the same values for every role group for every\r\nfeature. 9) Quantifying performance\r\nThere are multiple ways to quantify clustering performance, depending on the moti-\r\nvation. We quantify performance in two different ways. First, to see if clusters can be\r\nuser to group people of the same role, we compare the clusters via the role informa-\r\ntion as provided in the CERT dataset. This can be done either visually or using the\r\nRand index4. The Rand index is earlier elaborated upon in Section 2.3, and gives a\r\nscore between 0 and 1 on how similar two cluster divisions are. We use the version\r\nwhich adjusts for chance, to compensate for ’lucky guesses’ by our clustering algo-\r\nrithm. Another method to quantify clustering performance is to see how stable they are\r\nover time. This is achieved by applying the clustering algorithm based on the data of\r\ne.g. one month, and doing this for several months during a year. Then, we compare\r\neach month pair-wise via the abovementioned Rand index, using just the data from\r\nusers which were active in both periods and filtering out the malicious actors. This\r\nwill result per pair of months, a score on how similar the clusterings are. There is to\r\nour knowledge no literature performing such comparison over time hence we have\r\nno baseline of what values would be acceptable or good. Therefore, we assume that\r\nbenign user’s behaviour does not change between months and aim for the values\r\nclosest to 1.0 as possible, as this would mean an identical clustering.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2/xW9EoknwrRAQROp3fcmLhQbbz0PmW+3/JeYMg2GV8="},"ce53fc29-7863-4b31-92bd-5447c6a791fb":{"id_":"ce53fc29-7863-4b31-92bd-5447c6a791fb","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_37","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"7VCNXBdGzc8P7mNQzFCtMHmNyTUk2DcHU19K/5UJ0rE="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"75d2dc3a-7a2a-4236-93ff-3c9ee7e947b9","metadata":{"page_number":37,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"2/xW9EoknwrRAQROp3fcmLhQbbz0PmW+3/JeYMg2GV8="}},"text":"Having stable clusters means a SOC can take a user’s access behaviour over\r\na certain time period, compare it to the behaviour of all other users and determine\r\nwhose behaviour is alike.

METHODOLOGY\r\naccess behaviour change. A SOC analyst would take a closer look at the histori-\r\ncal behaviour of the user and gather contextual data to determine whether the be-\r\nhaviour is potentially malicious. If too many users change clusters two problems\r\narise when comparing different time periods. First, as a SOC analyst looks at all\r\nusers changing behaviour to determine its legitimacy, more users being marked as\r\nhaving suspicious behaviour leads to an increase in manual workload. Second, if\r\nusers change behaviour this will affect the location of their cluster’s centroid. The\r\ndynamic element of changing human behaviour is part of the reason why we ex-\r\npected ML to be more suitable for suspicious change detection rather than static\r\nthresholds. However, if many users change behaviour and thereby possible switch\r\nclusters, this affects the locations of all centroids. Then, it is not trivial anymore to\r\ndetermine which centroid’s cluster belonged to which group of users. Determining\r\nthis is necessary to detect which users changed behaviour more than the rest of\r\ntheir cluster. Therefore, this approach would only work if the number of distinguish-\r\nable user groups stays the same, and that the majority of the users stay in their own\r\ncluster over time. Huge behavioural shifts could be avoided by using smaller time\r\nperiods, however this increases the dataset skew as relative changes have a greater\r\ninfluence so might work counterproductive. We go further into this in Section 6.3. 4.2    Sentinel\r\nFor the analysis within Sentinel the analysis methodology is comparable to CERT’s\r\nSection 4.1, only the data types and performance quantification possibilities are dif-\r\nferent. Section 2.2 elaborates further on the functioning of Sentinel, including the\r\ndata and analysis possibilities. The analysis is performed within a Sentinel Note-\r\nbook, which is a Jupyter Notebook whose kernel runs on an Azure virtual machine. The Sentinel Notebook supports Python, ML libraries and supports integration with\r\nlogs stored in Sentinel. 1) Ethical caveat\r\nBecause this research incorporates data generated by humans, it requires approval\r\nby the ethics committee of the University of Twente. To gain this approval, we had to\r\nset strict limits on what our data and inferences can and cannot be used for. Because the dataset concerns human behaviour, a skew towards users behaving\r\nin  a  particular  manner  is  certainly  possible.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"uf4UzsUCILprXkN+OX7iF8LXcohNqnGzfF8/7yJKzqw="},"bdd60cc1-8f3b-4b22-a065-998dc720a17c":{"id_":"bdd60cc1-8f3b-4b22-a065-998dc720a17c","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_38","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"NsiMun0cdSRHia+Ln7XuYdZoVfyr3AY6jgcY1Y09NNc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1ac9635f-c829-48ef-85d7-d2755464c0ec","metadata":{"page_number":38,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"uf4UzsUCILprXkN+OX7iF8LXcohNqnGzfF8/7yJKzqw="}},"text":"We  need  to  keep  this  skew  for  this\r\napproach to function in the real world.

Furthermore, the Department\r\nand Jobtitle fields would be suitable as they place the users in distinct groups, how-\r\never in practice these are not filled out for a large portion of an organisation’s users,\r\nharming the analysis possibilities. We are left with the GroupMembership list. As\r\nthese can consist of multiple groups overlapping for different users, we cannot com-\r\npare it to the clustering as with other distinct groups. Therefore we need a different\r\nmethod to compare our clustering to these group memberships. The method for this\r\nis described in Algorithm 1. This results in a score between 0 and 1 per user, which\r\nis the average similarity per user.

This equalises the importance of all individual fea-\r\ntures, as they all have the same range, limiting the influence of outliers. The relative\r\ndifference between a feature’s value between different users stays the same. Another method of standardisation is achieved through QuantileTransformers11. This\r\nmethod  transforms  the  feature  values  to  follow  a  uniform  or  normal  distribution. Through this, the relative distance to outliers are reduced which limits their impact. Additionally,  values which are close together are spread out through this type of\r\ntransformation.

In addition, it does not\r\nrecognise clusters of different sizes well, whereas we could expect organisations to\r\nnot have evenly distributed groups of users with similar access behaviour. There-\r\nfore, we apply the DBSCAN clustering approach12to get an indication whether this\r\ncould outperform K-means clustering with regards to clustering consistency or com-\r\nparison to peers and AD groups. DBSCAN clustering recognises densely populated\r\nareas in a multidimensional space and groups the users within such areas together\r\nin a cluster. If an area is not densely populated, then the users within this area are\r\nnot put into a cluster at all. A single parameter is required for this function: theep-\r\nsilon.

RESULTS\r\nthis cannot be used to group users based on the resources they access. The cumu-\r\nlative difference from the mean feature was not used for clustering because of the\r\nskew it has dependant on the first day of the dataset. The access amount on the first\r\nday of the dataset sets the mean, and it takes a while for this skew to average out\r\nand for the mean number of daily accesses to reach an equilibrium. It also did not\r\ncontribute to identifying the users labelled insiders. This is most likely since the ma-\r\nlicious actions in the CERT dataset are not preceded by share discovery or lateral\r\nmovement. Because of this arbitrariness, and the unexplainability on its influence in\r\ngenerating logical clusters, we did not include this deviation feature in the clustering. Figure 5.1 shows the logon and logoff activity during different hours and days of\r\nthe week. This looks as expected: Office hours from 7:00 to roughly 21:00 and 33x\r\nas much activity during weekdays than in the weekend, or 13x as much on a daily\r\nbasis.

RESULTS\r\nApplying the same methodology using K=2 to other months resulted in the same\r\noutcome: ITAdmins and non-ITAdmins are consistently classified in a separate clus-\r\nter. There are some exceptions, which are highlighted at the end of this section. The\r\nscree plot returns that all the variance can be shown using solely PC (Principal Com-\r\nponent) 1, which is also visible in Figure 5.3, as the PC1 axis alone separates the\r\ntwo user groups. PC 1 is constructed through a combination of almost all features,\r\nthe division of which is shown in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4:Heatmap on how much every feature is used to display the two Principal\r\nComponents for the CERT dataset period 2010-04-01 until 2020-05-01. Feature importancesWe can look at what features caused the ITAdmins to be\r\nclassified in a different cluster than all other roles via the Feature Importance metrics. There are just two clusters, so the feature importances for cluster 0 are identical to\r\nthe feature importances for cluster 1, since the most influential feature causing a\r\nuser to be classified into cluster 0 is also the most influental feature causing a user\r\nto notbe classified into cluster 1. Figure 5.5 shows that the most influential features\r\nare the average number of daily accesses, the median session length and the total\r\nnumber of logons. The features differentiating the least between admins and other\r\nusers are the weekends logon,  the percentage thereof,  and the number of office\r\nhour accesses. Now that we know the feature importances we can look at the feature statistics\r\nof the clusters,  compare it with feature statistics on roles,  and verify whether the\r\nclustering is explainable. Figure 5.6 shows for the top three most influential features\r\nwhat the average, median and standard deviation is amongst the users of the two\r\ndifferent clusters.

This is likely caused by insider ITAdmins performing little\r\nactivity after their malicious actions, causing them to access less resources than a\r\nregular ITAdmin.

SENTINEL49\r\n5.2    Sentinel\r\nThis  part  of  the  research  was  conducted  in  the  Microsoft  Azure  Machine  Learn-\r\ning  Studio1,  a  cloud  Jupyter  notebook. We  perform  this  analysis  in  the  Sentinel\r\nenvironment using Northwave SOC customer data.Note:  Because this concerns\r\nprivacy-sensitive data, any information on user accounts and infrastructure has been\r\nanonymised. Preprocessing steps\r\nWithin Sentinel Notebook, the results of executing a query are saved in a dataframe. This process has a limit of 500.000 rows, which poses a problem when processing\r\ndata for larger organisations as they generate too many logon- and logoff Windows\r\nevents. This is because one user action is not necessarily correlated with one logon\r\nevent. Under the hood Windows can keep connecting and disconnecting to for ex-\r\nample a remote file server, causing a lot of events. This can lead to over 500.000\r\nevents on a single day alone. Therefore we reduce the granularity of the access\r\ntimes,  by summarizing all accesses with the same properties into one event per\r\nhour2. This reduces the data more than tenfold. Still, with this reduce of granularity\r\nthe largest timespan which can be queried at once is a week, instead of a month\r\nlike for the CERT dataset. In addition to removing accounts based on SID and account name, we attempted\r\nto cluster the dataset and removed outlier users which were placed in a cluster on\r\ntheir own. The purpose of this is to improve the clustering granularity for the rest of\r\nthe user-base. These accounts are consistently outliers amongst different weeks. It could not always be infered by the account name or description that they were\r\nautomated, so in reality would be worth an investigation from an analyst to identify\r\nwhy their access behaviour differs so significantly from the rest. More often than not,\r\nsuch outliers were accounts with administrator privileges as can be seen in Figure\r\n5.8, or were developer accounts. These were also commonly put in the same cluster\r\nin the iterative clustering phases, as seen in Appendix A.3. Whilst most users with\r\nadministrative rights were grouped together in one or two clusters, there were also a\r\nlot of non-administrative users part of these clusters.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WKWvoHsey7NdwWQQbjhACKbF3oE5qh1m2zqQ77OA03U="},"db647a55-acbc-499c-b52a-680c79cf5854":{"id_":"db647a55-acbc-499c-b52a-680c79cf5854","metadata":{"page_number":55,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_55","metadata":{"page_number":55,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"BAz+5obY3mqYokQ6buLXvKreU3beuZVL/gfUNgJal+k="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"65011dba-44e0-4433-8809-b4722956eb8a","metadata":{"page_number":55,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"WKWvoHsey7NdwWQQbjhACKbF3oE5qh1m2zqQ77OA03U="}},"text":"In addition, there are different\r\ndegrees of administrative rights within a domain, which we were unable to identify.

CLUSTERING CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS57\r\n5.3    Clustering consistency improvement efforts\r\nThis section lists the different efforts put into increasing the clustering consistency\r\nand similarity to UserPeerAnalytics and AD groups.

This lead to a slight improvement\r\nin clustering stability score, as seen in Figure 5.19, but is still far from a stable clus-\r\ntering. Additionally, the comparison to AD groups score increased to an average of\r\n0.47 amongst users, and the average UserPeer score increased to 0.30.

We tested a variety of input feature compositions, such as including matching\r\nthe CERT dataset features, or only incorporating destination hosts as features, but\r\nthese only decreased the consistency scores. Of the different logontypes, the net-\r\nwork logon was observed most. This is because of the way Windows operates in\r\nthe background when connecting to another device,  as explained in Section 4.2. Therefore, not every access logged correlates to a user interaction. To try and more\r\nclosely match the CERT dataset’s structure, we filtered on the LogonType 10: RDP\r\n(Remote Desktop). With this type of logon, one user action does correlate to a single\r\nlogon event. In addition, there are significantly fewer events hence we could incor-\r\nporate the data of an entire month and include the session duration feature. RDP is\r\nalso often used by threat actors to use a compromised account for lateral movement. Therefore this behaviour could visibly change compared to a user’s regular actions. Unfortunately, filtering on RDP only decreased the cluster stability when comparing\r\nconsecutive months, as shown in Figure 5.20.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\r\nITAdmins versus other users\r\nOur clustering approach can separate users with the ITAdmin role from regular users\r\nwith ease. The main defining features for this were the average daily accesses and\r\nsession length, as Appendix A.1 reveals that ITAdmins perform more and shorter\r\nsessions. This is an inference that we could not have gotten by reading the dataset\r\ndescription, which only decribes ITAdmins having global access privileges. As shown in Table 5.1, our clustering approach works well in detecting admin insid-\r\ners as they switch clusters in the period of their insider actions. Investigation of the logon actions of ITAdmin users revealed that they perform no\r\nfurther accesses soon after their last insider actions are performed. This decreases\r\nthe ITAdmin’s number of accesses for the month they performed malicious actions\r\nin, which skews their behaviour from an ITAdmin user to a regular user. Within the\r\nscenario where the CERT Insider Threat dataset is created this implies that after\r\nsomeone  has  performed  their  malicious  actions  they  leave  the  company  straight\r\naway. This type of detection limits itself to a certain type of insider, and could also\r\ntrigger when a user is less productive than regular. The latter is not a security risk\r\nand quite invasive,  and would be regarded as a False Positive for our algorithm. Therefore, in this case, our algorithm does not detect a suspicious change in be-\r\nhaviour through a user accessingmoreresources than usual, but by a user access-\r\ninglessresources than usual. This has overlap with the research topic of Quitting\r\nDetection. Quitting detection is a subject within Insider Threat detection research\r\nwhich focuses on predicting that a user will turn against their employer. This is used\r\nin the insider threat detection research by Gavai et al. [24], who use quitting detec-\r\ntion as a proxy for insider threat detection. Therefore, our clustering approach works\r\nwell in quitting detection for ITAdmins, but only after the user has actually quit. 6.2    Real-world production environment clustering\r\nObservations\r\nDue to the problems with query limits as described in Section 5.2, we performed\r\nthe majority of the clustering using one week of data.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qvCh2bwrMQQJBUhsx8PNq133+SIgS2nT+6nLIRF4tVc="},"727c6207-25fc-434e-b41b-98921c4f2afb":{"id_":"727c6207-25fc-434e-b41b-98921c4f2afb","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_68","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"OtpWQDfjNrzzlqv0qGJ+18c3ICL2RdHtj74XqouTmj8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"16505d16-f312-4b2e-b3c4-d1fc1768823c","metadata":{"page_number":68,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"qvCh2bwrMQQJBUhsx8PNq133+SIgS2nT+6nLIRF4tVc="}},"text":"Since this is relatively short,\r\nthe feature vector values are unlikely to converge (yet) for every user, as the mean,\r\nmedian and standard deviation shift with every added day of data.

To try and closer match the CERT dataset we filtered on\r\njust RDP connections, as these logon and logoff events are caused by human inter-\r\nactions instead of continuous background connections. This allowed re-introducing\r\nthe session-related features. The clustering plots changed, showing a clear diagonal\r\nline through the PCA plot. We did not perform further analysis on what this shape\r\nimplies on the underlying data, but the key inference is that most users are clustered\r\nclosely together. This likely causes K-means to classify many users differently over\r\ntime, leading to low similarity scores. As elaborated in the Methodology section,  one of the reasons we employ ML\r\nfor  our  feature  vectors  instead  of  static  thresholds  is  to  account  for  the  dynamic\r\nbehaviour users have. A user gets placed in a cluster relative to all other users. In\r\nthe case all other users change behaviour often according to our feature vectors,\r\nusers will be classified into different clusters often. This is the intended behaviour\r\nfor our algorithm,  but it leads to more workload for a SOC due to an increase in\r\nfalse positives and is, therefore, no added value to them. Besides this, if many users\r\nexhibit the same access behaviour,  the random factor in K-means clustering can\r\nclassify users bordering clusters differently every time. As previously discussed, the\r\nDBSCAN clustering method is not a viable alternative clustering option when aiming\r\nto monitor all users for suspicious access behaviour.

We accepted any possible bias in the data\r\nwith regards to for example demographic and user behaviour, as removing any skew\r\nfrom the dataset would make it less applicable to real-world data. The ML applied\r\nwould need to be as explainable and comprehensible, which limited the options and\r\ncontributed to choosing the primitive general-purpose K-means clustering method. Our methodology on feature creation and the clustering thereof was tested and val-\r\nidated the CERT dataset, which yielded positive results with regards to consistency. This looked promising for real-world data inferences. However, in reality, the values\r\nof the features created are too close together to create meaningful clusters or cre-\r\nate consistent user profile groups. Creating more granularity between users would\r\nrequire either different features from the current input data. More likely, however, it\r\nrequires different input data to be able to consistently differ between users, as this\r\nwas used by related work which achieved more successful profiling and detection\r\nscores. Comparison with similar research\r\nOur research applied a primitive clustering algorithm to access data to profile users\r\nconsistently. If consistent profiling was acquired, it would be possible to detect users\r\nwhich deviate from their previous known behaviour, or are an outlier to the rest of the\r\norganisation. This approach was validated using the synthetic CERT dataset, where\r\nusers were profiled consistently using mainly time and resource-based features. In\r\nproduction, using the same features, we could not achieve the same consistency in\r\nclustering due to the similarity in most users’ access behaviour. If we compare our\r\nresearch to other work in this field, they often use a more sophisticated ML approach\r\nwhich is more tailored to the data, but outperform our ability to identify suspicious\r\nuser  behaviour  by  far. In  comparison  with  the  majority  of  related  work,  we  only\r\nuse a fraction of their input data for creating feature vectors. Research with the\r\nsame objective as ours used the CERT dataset to benchmark their algorithm, but in\r\naddition to logon data incorporated amongst others HTTP traffic and email statistics\r\nto get a user profile. If a user suddenly visits more job searching websites, changes\r\nfrom their regular number of words per email or attaches more files to mails than\r\nusual, this can raise an alert.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wX99xlV5l1Vwl53aNkOGUDMxNLHOf/3FeJbnW9sl+zY="},"fa6deef0-4d05-4f08-a660-82c1f17d2230":{"id_":"fa6deef0-4d05-4f08-a660-82c1f17d2230","metadata":{"page_number":74,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_74","metadata":{"page_number":74,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"9MXNpMrIu68qPDCpdLHWSVbhMuzfhNNl7GvGkgVniRk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9c3b7e36-331d-42fc-b350-af5bb423074a","metadata":{"page_number":74,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"wX99xlV5l1Vwl53aNkOGUDMxNLHOf/3FeJbnW9sl+zY="}},"text":"We suspect that one of the main differences between\r\nour  work  and  others  with  the  same  objective,  is  that  we  attempted  to  detect  the\r\nirregularity in user behaviour by the user accessing a resource which is not common\r\nfor their account.

Quitting detection in production would be sig-\r\nnificantly more invasive than detecting the suspicious actions themselves, both in\r\nterms of data used and type of information inferred. The validation we performed\r\non the CERT dataset in terms of insider threat detection was also related to a user\r\nquitting their job, but only after the user had performed their malicious actions.

DISCUSSION ANDRECOMMENDEDRESEARCHDIRECTIONS\r\nIf parts of our approach are used in the future, it is recommended to change the\r\nclustering algorithm. The element of randomness in K-means clustering can cause\r\nusers in bordering clusters to switch continuously over time. Additionally, the grav-\r\nitational centers (centroids) tend towards larger groups. Many people sharing the\r\nsame behaviour will therefore skew the rest of the groups. In our research, every re-\r\nsource had as much influence as any other as feature in the multidimensional area,\r\nwhilst in reality some resources could be more relevant for clustering than others. This can be done according to the resource importance, or type such as file server\r\nor domain controller. That way, it is likely that one of the clusters will contain users\r\naccessing the crown jewels amongst resources, which are likely to be administra-\r\ntors. Giving weight to resources enables detecting users suddenly connecting to\r\nvital infrastructure whereas usually they did not. Combining this with other proper-\r\nties of an access event, such as using RDP for the first time to connect to a DC1, is\r\nsignificant data when keeping track of an ’anomaly score’, such as our cumulative\r\ndifference from the mean number of accesses. This also requires mapping adver-\r\nsarial actions to potential indicators in the data, the RDP connection to a DC in the\r\nbeforementioned case. In addition to resources, of the weight of any feature could\r\nof course be increased relative to less important features. Whilst we had statistics\r\nper cluster on which resources were accessed most often, this did not enable us to\r\ndraw a picture on what type of users populated a cluster. As the resources them-\r\nselves were a significant feature for the clustering, classifying the resources could\r\nshow a ’bigger picture’ of what types of resources users access, providing a better\r\npicture of a cluster’s regular behaviour. Therefore, in future research we would also\r\nrecommend categorizing the resources and using the categories as features. In the Sentinel data gathering phase our approach still required a lot of manual\r\nwork in removing outliers which were deemed automated accounts.

CONCLUSION\r\nbetween many user’s values, then small deviations can lead to significantly different\r\nclusterings. This is due to the the primitive method K-means works, combined with\r\nthe randomness of the initialisation phase. How  does  our  profiling  methodology  perform  within  the  CERT\r\nv4.2 synthetic dataset on consistency and extracting user groups? The profiling methodology creates a clear distinction between users with the ITAd-\r\nmin role and users without. The distinctive feature values of ITAdmins show that\r\nthey perform more accesses, have shorter session durations and more accesses\r\noutside of office hours compared to other users. Other than the ITAdmins, no clear\r\nrole distinction could be made. For the K=5 value the clusters are consistent with an\r\naverage adjusted Rand score of 0.87 for consecutive months. How does this profiling methodology translate to real-world data\r\nin terms of consistency and extracted user groups? For production data our features show less separation between the users, so slight\r\nbehavioural  changes  causes  users  to  switch  clusters  often. Additionally,  the  K-\r\nmeans initialisation phase is random so users close to bordering clusters can ran-\r\ndomly switch clusters. Increasing the timespan over which the features are created\r\nhas a slight positive effect on the consistency, but stays at an adjusted Rand score\r\nof 0.41 for consecutive periods. Hence,  the consistency does not come close to\r\nthe one achieved for the synthetic CERT dataset and cannot be used in practice for\r\nidentifying suspicious access behaviour. There is a mediocre similarity between our extracted clusters, AD groups and Mi-\r\ncrosoft UEBA’s UserPeerAnalytics. The scores for our custom performance metrics\r\ndo not come close to the hypothetical maximum of 1.0, but are consistently better\r\ncompared to users being classified into clusters at random. This implies there is a\r\nsignal in the data, but via our methodology does not lead to usable results.

This is likely due quitting after the malicious\r\nactions have taken place. For real-world data, we conclude that there is not enough granularity between these\r\nfeatures to consistently profile users. Through this methodology, it is not possible\r\nto determine deviating behaviour accurately using solely logon data. Profiling users\r\nconsistently using explainable clustering requires at least different pre-processing\r\nto bring more granularity to the available data. The exact insider threat or account\r\ncompromise actions should be determined beforehand to tailor to an adversarial in-\r\ndicator. More invasive data is likely required to differ between users, as was used by\r\nsimilar research to achieve higher insider threat and account compromise detection\r\nscores. To summarise, we converted non-invasive access logs into a feature vector per user. We applied K-means clustering to these feature vectors and compared the formed\r\nclusters with known user groups. We also compared clusters of different periods in\r\ntime to each other. Whilst for a synthetical dataset this yielded promising results,\r\nin production data we could not get useful inferences from the resulting clusters. It\r\nwas also not possible to construct consistent user profiles over time, since we were\r\nunable to separate users clearly on their access behaviour. Therefore it could not\r\nbe used by a SOC to detect suspicious deviations in user access behaviour. Because of these findings, the Northwave SOC is looking into how they can include\r\nother types of data to achieve more granularity between users. Since we were un-\r\nable  to  use  the  clusters  in  a  meaningful  manner  in  a  real-world  setting,  another\r\nMachine Learning method will be applied that is targeted solely at anomaly detec-\r\ntion.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"LIGLeSLolVXJQZqnZC2KOzA4r8b42IxSa8nvsBV3OBY="},"b3e66ca4-7a34-4115-8d8e-f39c4027cc48":{"id_":"b3e66ca4-7a34-4115-8d8e-f39c4027cc48","metadata":{"page_number":82,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf_82","metadata":{"page_number":82,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf","file_name":"PROFILING USERS BY ACCESS BEHAVIOUR USING DATA AVAILABLE TO A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER.pdf"},"hash":"JHkJ2TboGZelYBr6ThsHjzGgjZefcFs9GhtF8kwAUik="}},"text":"76                                                                                                 CHAPTER7.

I. INTRODUCTION \r\nCybercriminals  often  focus  their  attention  on  healthcare \r\nproviders  and  related  institutions. The  continuum  of  care \r\nresults  in  a  landscape  that  is  convoluted  and  diverse  in  terms \r\nof the individuals, devices, apps, and procedures that comprise \r\nit. This landscape provides potential entry points for attackers \r\ninto  the network. A  further  tactic  that  attackers  might  use  to \r\ncarry out ransomware attacks is to threaten the interruption of \r\nessential  life-saving  utilities. The  culmination  of  all  these \r\nactions  produces  data  that  may  be  put  to  use  to  trace  down \r\nattackers and stop them in their path. Indicators of data breach \r\nmay  be  found  across  all  sectors,  but  healthcare  organizations \r\nwant   high-quality   data   that   is   tailored   to   their   operating \r\nconditions in order to cut down on the amount of time it takes \r\nto discover and react to threats. Due to the sensitive nature of \r\npatient  data,  the  healthcare  business  is  a  top  target  for  the \r\nperpetration   of   cyberattacks. It   is   possible   for   patients, \r\nhealthcare  professionals,  and  healthcare  organizations  to  face \r\nserious repercussions as a result of the theft, loss, or improper \r\nuse of sensitive information.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"iIC9BVCRvhe/FhdxRTKDOWCyVJhisWsfUzQy5Q49CBo="},"5ac6fcbb-6343-4608-a11c-c9e244d971b1":{"id_":"5ac6fcbb-6343-4608-a11c-c9e244d971b1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf","file_name":"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf","file_name":"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf"},"hash":"VQjKTuixwMVYXtwWngDunon09rhioh3pvA6I3Qe9hGg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"157d1257-4d45-4f7f-a883-a5a332fb30c5","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf","file_name":"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf"},"hash":"iIC9BVCRvhe/FhdxRTKDOWCyVJhisWsfUzQy5Q49CBo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4a6e94e9-db1a-41e0-9771-08ee59942613","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf","file_name":"Security Operation Center for Healthcare Sector.pdf"},"hash":"7SlK2AaCylnz1GvU/JESxhblwpA303693uTSXqPaLuU="}},"text":"As a result, it is essential to have \r\nan  efficient  cybersecurity  plan  in  order  to  safeguard  patient \r\ndata  and  stay  in  compliance  with  HIPAA  regulations. An \r\nautomated  SOC can  identify  and react to potential dangers in \r\nreal   time,   making   it   possible   to   take   a   complete   and \r\npreventative  approach  to  information  security. The  manual \r\nSOC  technique  that  has  been  used  in  the  past  is  no  longer \r\nadequate due to the growing number of cyber threats and their \r\nincreased   complexity. An   automated   Security   Operations \r\nCenter  (SOC)  can  analyze  vast  amounts  of  data,  identify \r\ntrends, and detect dangers that human analysts may overlook. This advantage over traditional SOCs allows for automation of \r\nmundane tasks like patch management, vulnerability scanning, \r\nand  incident  response,  freeing  security  analysts  to  focus  on \r\nmore important responsibilities. This  leads  to  enhanced  efficiency  and  efficacy  in  threat \r\ndetection  and  response,  reducing  the  risk  of  cyberattacks  and \r\ndata breaches. An  automated  SOC  plays  a  crucial  role  in \r\nprotecting patient data and maintaining HIPAA compliance. It \r\nenables  real-time  detection  and  response  to  cyber  threats, \r\nminimizing  the  risk  of  data  breaches  and  cyber  assaults.

The framework is developed using the design science research methodology and has been validated by generating \r\nfour novel metrics to assess the technical performance of a SOC. Additionally, the study examines the existing \r\nlandscape of metrics for SOCs and concludes that a majority of the metrics discussed in the literature primarily \r\nfocus on operational aspects rather than technical performance. The absence of adequate technical performance \r\nmetrics makes it challenging to accurately evaluate the tangible impact of a SOC on overall cyber defense \r\ncapabilities. The research also highlights the insufficiency of current methods in constructing metrics and \r\nframeworks tailored for measuring SOCs’ technical performance. The resulting framework offers SOCs means to \r\ncreate high-quality metrics for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the metrics the framework was validated \r\nwith offer SOCs an opportunity to enhance their ability to quantify their threat detection capabilities. 1. Introduction\r\nCyber threats have evolved dramatically over the last few years. They have become more sophisticated and complex, and as a result, \r\nthey have a greater impact on operational activities. The use of general-\r\npurpose malware has declined recently and more advanced threats, \r\nsuch as supply chain compromises, extortion activities, misinformation \r\ncampaigns, and business e-mail compromises, are continuously increas-\r\ning (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, 2021).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"x7qh+vprXQdgsfKqcOgVqtkvXWFNSOHt4ydKCeZO1Qo="},"de9ecc9f-6fc7-4797-8049-fd93c08631eb":{"id_":"de9ecc9f-6fc7-4797-8049-fd93c08631eb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"Iapi4a7qu3GNEh/ovH1UtcPknEnzD8fTsnOsJDWv4Gk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"441ccf01-c91a-4483-b6da-ee5242722c0e","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"x7qh+vprXQdgsfKqcOgVqtkvXWFNSOHt4ydKCeZO1Qo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"08f1746d-194f-44c7-8e70-d23868388e01","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"7eh1EUL2ftUxXAs/ozpRICMNKCrL2+AhbBdmaER+gGs="}},"text":"The increased \r\nsophistication and the associated risks require organizations to improve \r\ntheir defensive capabilities for combatting the evolving threat landscape \r\nbecause traditional malware and network defenses are not enough to \r\nprotect the organization from modern-day cyber threats. A strategy for organizations to increase their cyber defense capa-\r\nbilities is to acquire security operations center (SOC) capabilities. On \r\na general level, the SOC operations can be produced in-house, out-\r\nsourced to a managed service provider, or operated in a hybrid model in \r\nwhich the internal SOC is complemented by an external SOC provider. According to Nathans (2014), a SOC is typically responsible for detect-\r\ning security incidents and initiating related incident response activities. Nathans also determined that depending on the size and the needs of \r\nthe organization, the SOC can consist of a single person or a larger \r\nteam working in 24/7 shifts that together form a coherent collection \r\nof different competencies to prevent, detect, and resolve cyber threats. Furthermore, Vielberth et al. (2020)mentioned there are several ways \r\n* Corresponding author.

To quantify the operational efficiency and capabilities of a SOC, \r\nperformance should be measured using a set of commonly agreed met-\r\nrics. A literature survey performed by Vielberth et al. (2020)concluded \r\nthat the currently established metrics are insufficient for measuring the \r\nperformance of the SOC. This viewpoint is supported by Kokulu et al. (2019), Agyepong et al. (2020)and Sundaramurthy et al. (2015). Multiple publications on SOCs focus primarily on quantitative vol-\r\nume and time-based operational and vulnerability-related metrics to \r\nmeasure the performance of SOCs (Nathans, 2014; Ahlm, 2021; Kokulu \r\net al., 2019). The operational metrics can help managers measure and \r\noptimize human resource utilization in analysis. Other quantitative met-\r\nrics, such as vulnerability-related data, can provide an overview of the \r\noverall exposure to known threats (Nathans, 2014).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9ehVvC0boHYQOagKNSaJlWuPyPRv0Ar9RpCiwjldLrQ="},"08f1746d-194f-44c7-8e70-d23868388e01":{"id_":"08f1746d-194f-44c7-8e70-d23868388e01","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_1","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"Iapi4a7qu3GNEh/ovH1UtcPknEnzD8fTsnOsJDWv4Gk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"de9ecc9f-6fc7-4797-8049-fd93c08631eb","metadata":{"page_number":1,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"9ehVvC0boHYQOagKNSaJlWuPyPRv0Ar9RpCiwjldLrQ="}},"text":"In practice, they \r\nare inefficient in measuring the capabilities of SOCs, because they can-\r\nnot measure the effectiveness of the detection capabilities and other \r\nprotective controls.

An argument could be made that an industry standard framework \r\nfor measuring SOCs does not exist at the moment. The lack of com-\r\nmonly accepted methods to measure the technical performance of a \r\nSOC is particularly prominent when the SOC is being outsourced to a \r\nthird-party vendor. This often leads to a situation where the tender-\r\ning process produces a suboptimal result, either by selecting the vendor \r\nwith the lowest total service cost or the most convincing sales mate-\r\nrial. In Finland, a trend has been observed, where vendors are chosen \r\non a proof of concept phase, in which an attack simulation is performed \r\nin an environment temporarily monitored by the vendor and afterward \r\ntheir threat detection capabilities are evaluated. The trend is essentially \r\na manifestation of the difficulty in evaluating the technical capabilities \r\nof different vendors. Although it can provide useful insights when com-\r\nparing vendors, the results are not truly comparable between vendors \r\nbecause the number of resources allocated to the proof of concept can \r\nsignificantly impact the final results and thus skew the vendor selection. The objective of this study was to determine the metrics and other per-\r\nformance indicators relevant for measuring the technical performance of a \r\nSOC.

A technical performance metric within this paper is defined as \r\na qualitative or quantitative indicator derived from one or more measure-\r\nments resulting from the activities performed by the SOC, which describes \r\nhow well the SOC can utilize technologies to prevent, identify, detect, and \r\nrespond to cyber threats affecting the organization.Compared to an opera-\r\ntional performance metric, a technical performance metric attempts to \r\nquantify the defensive capabilities, rather than assessing the effective-\r\nness of processes and people associated with the SOC. Understanding \r\nboth the operational and technical efficiency of the SOC is required to \r\nsuccessfully protect an organization from cyber threats and measure the \r\neffectiveness of the SOC.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ioDjAraxGekBqxl/2Q3Bfiv3WxnRAPNpT4iTCMJWfIE="},"ba2dfe1a-438c-4f8e-b38b-c5f608309072":{"id_":"ba2dfe1a-438c-4f8e-b38b-c5f608309072","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"7hyytanhv8RlGDYtKIXAsyGWpRiuwLSw2LcQWpgK2cU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"78224b70-1d1b-4ddd-ad07-d113c27de4e7","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"ioDjAraxGekBqxl/2Q3Bfiv3WxnRAPNpT4iTCMJWfIE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"49c1e477-7f21-421a-ab16-4996348da1b5","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"dUgznndGPCrKhLZUHjQvqwbrqFxWIXy4ag0yRxfn6j0="}},"text":"The objective leads to the following research questions: (1) What \r\nframeworks are available to measure the performance of a SOC?(2) What \r\nare the commonly mentioned key metrics used to measure a SOC?(3) Can \r\nthe common metrics be used to measure the technical performance?(4) How \r\ncan the metrics be improved to enhance the reporting capabilities of technical \r\nperformance?The expected outcome of the research is a novel frame-\r\nwork that could contribute to an industry-standard way to measure the \r\ntechnical performance of a SOC and apply to most SOCs. 2.

(2007), in which a design science artifact is \r\ngenerated as an outcome of an iterative process with the following ac-\r\ntivities: (1) Identify the problem and motivation, (2) Define the objectives of \r\na solution, (3) Design and development, (4) Demonstration, (5) Evaluation\r\nand (6) Communication. The first activity is covered in sections1, 3and 4of this research, \r\nthe second in section5, the third in section6, the fourth in section7and \r\nthe fifth in sections8and 9. This research as a whole covers the sixth \r\nactivity. The second activity is supported by a brief literature review of \r\nboth academic publications and commercial sources to establish suffi-\r\ncient theoretical background on the subject, and to answer the research \r\nquestions (1) and (2). A keyword search is used as the search method \r\nfor the discovery of literature related to SOCs and metrics. The search \r\nquery for SOC-related literature is ‘(security OR cyber security) (oper-\r\nations OR operation) (center OR centre)’and the metric-related search \r\nquery is ‘(metric OR measurement OR “performance indicator”)’. The lit-\r\nerature review was performed between May and September in the year \r\n2022 and updated in August 2023. JYKDOK,1IEEE Xplore2and Google \r\nScholar3were used as the search engines. The research is expected to result in a design science artifact, a \r\nframework that can be utilized to create metrics to measure the tech-\r\nnical performance of SOCs.

Security operations center\r\nTo tackle the first phase of the design science research, problem iden-\r\ntification, we first introduce, how technical performance metrics target \r\nenvironments, i.e., SOCs, are described in the literature. One method to \r\ndescribe a SOC is through a People, Processes, and Technologies (PPT) \r\nframework (Knerler et al., 2022; Vielberth et al., 2020). Vielberth et al. (2020)summarized that the people block describes the people associ-\r\nated with the SOC and their required competencies, the process block \r\ndescribes how the people interact and how security incidents are han-\r\ndled, and the technology block describes the tools used to do the work. They also argued that the PPT framework could be expanded to in-\r\nclude governance and compliance, enabling organizations to utilize the \r\nSOC as a function to ensure compliance with various standards, such as \r\nISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, or PCI-DSS. Vielberth et al. (2020)stated, that the work performed at a SOC \r\nis heavily driven by processes, as the work is structured around the \r\nprevention, detection, and response of security incidents. The Com-\r\nputer Security Incident Handling Guide (NIST SP 800-61, Cichonski et \r\nal. (2012)) describes the security incident management process, which \r\nconsists of four phases “preparation,” “detection and analysis,” “con-\r\ntainment, eradication, and recovery,” and “post-incident activity,” as \r\ndepicted in Fig.1. The purpose of the preparation phase is to ensure the \r\nSOC has the necessary visibility and potential to detect and respond to \r\nsecurity incidents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dUgznndGPCrKhLZUHjQvqwbrqFxWIXy4ag0yRxfn6j0="},"f61984a7-c43a-4f84-bf24-0dae46547cd2":{"id_":"f61984a7-c43a-4f84-bf24-0dae46547cd2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"7hyytanhv8RlGDYtKIXAsyGWpRiuwLSw2LcQWpgK2cU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"49c1e477-7f21-421a-ab16-4996348da1b5","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"dUgznndGPCrKhLZUHjQvqwbrqFxWIXy4ag0yRxfn6j0="}},"text":"The preparation stage also includes activities aiming \r\nto prevent security incidents altogether, such as malware prevention or \r\nuser awareness training. The detection and analysis phase consists of \r\nresponding to security incidents by analyzing, documenting, and pri-\r\noritizing them and finally notifying the necessary people. The third \r\nphase is about containing the security incident by limiting the poten-\r\ntial damage the incident may cause, followed by evidence gathering \r\nand identifying the attackers’ host. Once the impact of the incident has \r\nbeen limited and the source of the attack has been identified, the threat \r\ncan be eradicated, and recovery actions can be started (Cichonski et al., \r\n2012). The final stage, post-incident activity, does not contain activities \r\nfor which the SOC would typically be responsible. Other processes in \r\nthe SOC can, for example, include data collection and creation, valida-\r\ntion, and tuning monitoring rules (Knerler et al., 2022).

Metrics and measurements\r\nThe primary purpose of a metric is to measure how well a business \r\nprocess, product, or resource performs so that a business decision can \r\nbe made Savola (2007). Typically, a metric consists of one or more dis-\r\ncrete point-in-time measurements, from which metrics are then derived. Savola (2013)continues that to produce quality metrics for security, the \r\nmetrics must conform to four fundamental quality criteria: correctness, \r\nmeasurability, meaningfulness, and usability. 4.1. Constructing metrics\r\nMetrics can be structured in multiple ways. A metric can simply \r\nbe a direct relation to a measurement, such as the number of security \r\nincidents, or it can be a composite metric constructed by multiple mea-\r\nsurements collected from multiple sources. An example of a composite \r\nmetric is depicted in Fig.2, in which the metric is constructed from mul-\r\ntiple measurements. Measurement A collects the detections generated \r\nby security tooling, such as Security Information Event Management \r\n(SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), or Intrusion Detection \r\nSystem (IDS). The detections generated by the tools are analyzed by se-\r\ncurity analysts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"9sEindqRci7GYIYe1Sgic30XO4NlIr46xrLNcBBC8uE="},"e52527a8-ec63-4f5d-a200-07cc6a1c0606":{"id_":"e52527a8-ec63-4f5d-a200-07cc6a1c0606","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"QszMS6BalR8JEiu0TdzTzqB9WK0QtZjXMb1ruTyX2zU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e3c4f472-e098-4b45-847b-9d174194dda1","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"9sEindqRci7GYIYe1Sgic30XO4NlIr46xrLNcBBC8uE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6bb9e251-ddd4-4a3c-96e7-5f80316a3cbb","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"j21Xtu1TU5WJaCq6bFLhzbT+Enx/G5ilRX+iIeEV8Qs="}},"text":"The detections generated by the tools are analyzed by se-\r\ncurity analysts. Measurement B consists of reports from end-users and \r\nother third parties about possible security incidents, such as suspected \r\nphishing or security policy violations. Similar to measurement A, the \r\ntickets in measurement B are investigated by the analysts. The metric \r\nconfiguration selects the measurements, for which the reaction time by \r\nthe analysts exceeds the pre-determined value. The reaction time could \r\nfor example be defined in a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a \r\nSOC and other stakeholders. There are several ways to construct or select metrics that measure \r\nthe outcome of an activity. A study by Doran (1981)describes a method \r\nthat utilizes the S.M.A.R.T. method, which is an acronym for specific, \r\nmeasurable, assignable, realistic, and time-related, to select a suitable \r\nmetric. Brotby and Hinson (2013)introduces the PRAGMATIC method \r\nthat consists of nine meta metrics (predictive, relevant, actionable, gen-\r\nuine, meaningful, accurate, timely, independent, and cheap), which are \r\nessentially scoring criteria for the metric itself. The S.M.A.R.T. and PRAGMATIC methods are more about select-\r\ning metrics and which principles should be embraced when a metric \r\nis constructed. There are also other methods to construct metrics. For \r\nexample, the Annex A of the ISO/IEC 27004:2016 (2016)standard sum-\r\nmarizes a measurement information model contained in the ISO/IEC \r\n15939 standard and describes how specific attributes related to an en-\r\ntity can be converted into an information product that can be used for \r\nconducting business decisions. 4.2. Problems and pitfalls of metrics\r\nMetrics can provide valuable insights into the performance of an or-\r\nganization. However, when incorrectly constructed, they can become \r\ncounterproductive. The metric can be incorrect due to a problem with \r\nthe raw measurements, a programming error in the algorithm used to \r\nderive the metric, or someone is either maliciously or non-maliciously \r\nmisinterpreting the metric (Brotby and Hinson, 2013).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"rtPRgjfNSE9oAkUh7BzStydSnHPC8j8hSlo0TbjuZSc="},"6bb9e251-ddd4-4a3c-96e7-5f80316a3cbb":{"id_":"6bb9e251-ddd4-4a3c-96e7-5f80316a3cbb","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"QszMS6BalR8JEiu0TdzTzqB9WK0QtZjXMb1ruTyX2zU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e52527a8-ec63-4f5d-a200-07cc6a1c0606","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"rtPRgjfNSE9oAkUh7BzStydSnHPC8j8hSlo0TbjuZSc="}},"text":"Hauser and Katz \r\n(1998)argues that it might also be possible that certain metrics, which \r\nare hard to influence by the activities of team members, might lead to \r\na situation where short-term decisions are favored over long-term deci-\r\nsions. A metric may also be precisely wrong, meaning that something \r\nis measured with high accuracy, but the metric does not improve the \r\nbusiness process it is supposed to improve (Hauser and Katz, 1998). We can also approach the problems with metrics from the quality \r\nperspective. An attribute closely related to correctness is unbiasedness \r\nand objectivity, meaning the interpretation of the metric should not be \r\ninfluenced by personal beliefs or biases (Savola, 2007). Similarly, repro-\r\nducibility is closely related to measurability. If a result from a metric \r\ncannot be reliably reproduced, the metric may produce an incorrect \r\nvalue.

Nonetheless, they \r\nfailed to show meaningful metrics in several areas, such as automation \r\n& orchestration, threat hunting, and detection engineering & validation.

He presented qualitative metrics, such \r\nas the top 10 vulnerable endpoints, and quantitative metrics, including \r\nthe number of vulnerable endpoints, the number of vulnerabilities per \r\nseverity, the number of unknown assets, and the time it took to apply a \r\npatch that fixed the vulnerability. However, the proposed metrics were \r\nnot sufficient to be used to demonstrate the technical capabilities of the \r\nSOC. Agyepong et al. (2020)presented a framework in which a SOC was \r\nsplit into multiple functions. Each function was measured separately to \r\ndetermine the actual performance of it. These functions included mon-\r\nitoring and detection, analysis, response and reporting, intelligence, \r\nbaseline and vulnerability, and policies and signature management. The \r\nframework proposed that each function should monitor its performance \r\nin quantitative and qualitative metrics. The framework did not provide \r\nconcrete measurement mechanisms upon which organizations can im-\r\nplement the metrics defined in the framework. Keltanen (2019)used results from a customer survey to measure the \r\nperformance of an outsourced SOC. He ranked the metrics based on the \r\nPRAGMATIC method. The resulting score will help evaluate different \r\nmetrics between one another, making it possible to determine which \r\nmetric is considered to be the most important (Keltanen, 2019).

Onwubiko (2015)presented a framework consisting of metrics used \r\nto evaluate SOCs’ performance and determine the return on investment. The framework does not contain a concrete set of metrics, but instead, \r\nit provides the top five examples that should be considered, which are \r\nthe number of incidents, the performance of the cyber operations, the \r\ntop ten cyber attacks, a summary of policy violations and a summary of \r\nprivileged user misuse detections. Alahmadi et al. (2022)present a comprehensive qualitative study \r\nof SOC analysts’ perspectives on security alarms. The authors state \r\nthat security alarm validation is a tedious task that can cause alarm \r\nburnout and eventually desensitization.

They also argue that researchers have used false-\r\npositive as a metric for evaluating system performance when proposing \r\nsecurity tools, seeking few false-positives for optimal performance. In addition to scientific literature, there is a plethora of commer-\r\ncial material that discusses the metrics to measure SOCs. Zimmerman \r\nand Crowley (2019)presented seven high-level groups for the metrics. The groups are the health of the data feed, coverage of the monitoring, \r\nvulnerability-related metrics, monitoring rules, analysts’ performance, \r\nincident handling, risk priorities, and general hygiene. Gartner published a guide (Ahlm, 2021) discussing the industry’s \r\nbest practices for building and operating a modern SOC, among which \r\na set of fundamental metrics were defined. The metrics mainly focused \r\non quantitative metrics and were grouped into four categories: incident \r\nvolume, incident detection, incident response, and incident impact. The \r\nmetrics in these categories, for most parts, are not relevant to the tech-\r\nnical performance of the SOC.

The three least com-\r\nmonly deployed metrics were “Losses accrued vs. losses prevented,” \r\n“Monetary cost per incident,” and “Avoidability of the incident,” all \r\nof which are relatively difficult to implement. Out of the metrics men-\r\ntioned, there were a few metrics that are relevant for measuring the \r\ntechnical performance of the SOC, which are “Threat actor attribution,” \r\n“Thoroughness of eradication,” and “Thoroughness and accuracy of en-\r\nterprise sweeping. ”\r\nLogsign (2020)groups recommended metrics into two categories, \r\nmetrics for security operations and metrics related to business require-\r\nments. The number of security incidents was raised as the most impor-\r\ntant metric for security operations. It also depicted metrics, such as the \r\nnumber of alerts per analyst, the number of alerts closed by automa-\r\ntion, the number of false-positive alerts, and the average time to detect \r\na security incident. A blog post by Simos and Dellinger (2019)presented some of the key \r\nmetrics used at the Microsoft SOC.

He identified 28 security metrics categorized \r\ninto either management, operational, or technical metrics. The study \r\ncontained no metrics that directly relate to the technical performance \r\nof a SOC. However, several metrics are closely related to the typical \r\nactivities of the SOC, such as the business impact of security incidents, \r\ncharacteristics of security incidents, and system vulnerabilities. As a summary of SOC metrics, Table1describes the top thirty most \r\ncommonly mentioned metrics in the literature, i.e., the number aster-\r\nisks depict how many articles the metric was mentioned in. A full list of \r\nthe metrics observed has been published in Mendeley Data (Forsberg, \r\n2023). In Table1, one of the metrics was combined into a general-\r\nized term instead of having two separate rows for “time to resolution” \r\nand “time to incident closure. ” Another general level observation was \r\nthat the terminology does not appear to be consistent in the literature. For example, the metric “mean time to detect” is used to describe at \r\nleast two different behaviors, the time it takes to react and perform the \r\nanalysis of the alert (Ahlm, 2021; Agyepong et al., 2020; Crowley and \r\nPescatore, 2019) and time it takes for a SOC to become aware of the in-\r\ncident (Logsign, 2020; Vielberth et al., 2020).

ISO/IEC 27004. It is a metric that can easily be collected and used outside of the scope \r\nof SOC. Vulnerability-related metrics are also relatively common, with \r\nthe count of vulnerabilities being mentioned in seven publications. The \r\nmean time to vulnerability remediation and the count of vulnerable de-\r\nvices were mentioned in four publications. Operative metrics, such as \r\nmean time to reaction, detection, resolution, containment, triage, and \r\nescalation, were also commonly mentioned. The publications also con-\r\ntained a few technical performance metrics. They were false-positive \r\nrate, threat actor attribution, the number of security incidents closed \r\nwith automation, and the quality of eradication. The literature review emphasizes the need for a common framework \r\nthat could be used for the performance evaluation of SOCs globally. The \r\nmetrics presented in Table1are scattered broadly, and there appears \r\nto be no common group of key metrics used to measure the tech-\r\nnical performance of a SOC.

Further-\r\nmore, based on the authors’ first-hand experience, many of the metrics \r\nused for measuring SOC are of low quality, particularly regarding bias \r\nand objectivity. This viewpoint is partially supported by Kokulu et al. (2019). However, the quality aspect of the metrics was not discussed in \r\ndetail in the SOC-related literature to form a valid conclusion about the \r\ninsufficient quality. To ensure the resulting metrics are of high quality, \r\nquality criteria for SOC metrics should be defined. The justification for the objectives 3 and 4 is the same, which is the \r\nuniversal applicability of the resulting metrics. In practice, this means \r\nthe metrics should be usable by most SOCs out there, provided that they \r\ninclude the function to which the metric is tied. Finally, the justification \r\nfor the objective 5 is that the metrics in some situations do not appear to \r\nbe backed up by scientific research, particularly regarding commercial \r\nsources, which means the metrics are purely based on the authority of \r\nthe author. 6. The metric creation framework\r\nThis section presents the creation of the design science artifact, i.e., \r\na metric creation framework. It can be used to construct metrics used to \r\nmeasure the performance of a SOC. The artifact is evaluated by utilizing \r\nit to create metrics to measure the technical performance of the SOC.

The first stage consists of the \r\nsolution objectives, and the second stage is the metric creation frame-\r\nwork that consists of the requirements the metric should conform to \r\nand the characteristics that must be describable in the metric documen-\r\ntation, see Fig.4. A valid metric must fulfill both the metric requirements and the \r\ncharacteristics. The metric requirements are:\r\n1. The metric has a clear and well-defined goal. 2.

If we can reduce bias to a minimum and ensure the metric is objec-\r\ntive, we can fulfill the most important quality criterion, correctness. There can also be situations where a counter-metric or other addi-\r\ntional contextual information is needed. For example, a SOC may have a \r\nmetric to measure the number of distinct monitoring rules, which could \r\nbe used to measure the detection potential of the SOC. However, the \r\nhigh number of monitoring rules does not directly correlate with the \r\nperformance of the SOC, since if a majority of the security incidents re-\r\nsulting from the monitoring rules are false-positive, the SOC is unlikely \r\nto be able to handle them effectively (Alahmadi et al., 2022). There-\r\nfore, the metric for the number of monitoring rules should be coupled \r\nwith the false-positive rate to measure the effective detection potential. As the metrics consist of measurements, the source for the measure-\r\nment data must be defined along with the format of measurement, the \r\nmeasurement interval, and any other information that affects the mea-\r\nsurements or metrics in any way. For example, a metric measuring the \r\nmean time to resolution would require each security incident to have \r\ntwo measurements, one to measure the time when the incident was \r\nopened and another one to measure the time when the incident has \r\nbeen resolved.

Metrics for security operations center\r\nThis section describes how the metrics meet the objectives defined \r\nin the metric creation framework. Measurements used to construct the \r\nmetrics have been programmatically generated and presented using \r\nopen-source tools and Python modules, most prominently Jupyter Note-\r\nbooks4and a Python graphing library Plotly.5Additionally, scikit-learn, \r\nwhich is a Python module that can be used for data analysis and ma-\r\nchine learning algorithm development (Pedregosa et al., 2011), was \r\nused to calculate the statistical fitting of a trend line in the form of \r\nlinear regression. The parameters for creating the data points are ad-\r\njusted every 100 steps to create variation in the results over time. The \r\nsource code for the metrics is published in Mendeley Data (Forsberg, \r\n2023). 7.1.

The metric \r\nis tied to a function responsible for custom analytics and detection cre-\r\nation, as per the definition by Knerler et al. (2022). If the SOC does not \r\nhave a team responsible for the function, the metric is not measuring \r\nthe performance of a SOC but rather the tools the SOC is using. In that \r\ncase, the metric depends on third parties and thus is not a valid metric \r\nfor a SOC.

Both strategies statistically have a similar amount of detections \r\nin the final phase of the kill chain. Thus, both are equally effective in \r\npreventing adversaries from achieving their objectives. However, the \r\nstrategy focusing on the initial foothold stage is better in terms of the \r\nmetric, as it is more effective at preventing the incidents from traversing \r\nforward within the UKC.

Fig.7depicts two ways to present the metric, one as a combined \r\nbar and line chart and another as a line chart, depicting the evolution \r\nof the metric over time. The bar chart displays the number of distinct \r\nmonitoring rules and the sum of verifiable monitoring rules per MITRE \r\nATT&CK tactic. Next to the bars is a trend line displaying the percentage \r\nof verifiable monitoring rules. The value of the metric is the mean of the \r\npercentage of the monitoring rules covered per MITRE ATT&CK tactic \r\nat a given time. The intended way to interpret the metric is to follow \r\nthe trend of the mean to determine whether the SOC is improving over \r\ntime. For the metric to provide meaningful information, it needs a \r\ncounter-metric that displays the number of distinct monitoring rules, \r\nas shown in the blue bars in Fig.7. If the SOC has a low number of \r\nmonitoring rules, the metric value can be abnormally high, increas-\r\ning bias and decreasing the comparability of results between different \r\nSOCs. The number of monitoring rules can also be misleading, as there \r\nis a possibility of creating many low-fidelity monitoring rules. As the metric measures only the number of verifiable monitoring \r\nrules resulting from the SOC development efforts, it fails to demonstrate \r\nthe verification capabilities of native vendor detections. This makes the \r\nmetric subjective, as some SOCs are likely to rely more on native capa-\r\nbilities for threat detection than others, making the metric inefficient \r\nfor comparing metric values from one SOC to one another, even if their \r\noperative models would be similar. A dimension that displays the num-\r\nber of vendor-native detections that can be tested could be added to \r\nthe metric. However, doing so would increase the bias of the metric. A better solution would be to create a separate metric for measuring \r\nthe number of verifiable vendor-native scenarios and construct another \r\nmetric that considers both metrics. The metric is not considered to be \r\nvalid in terms of the metric creation framework, as the metric is highly \r\nsubjective and overly biased.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"riMso3+lA19Aw1/+yp4PM6WbpAPspE0UbqTEPVwu5ZE="},"aee0f39b-a30c-4af1-ad6a-1edfd0e24262":{"id_":"aee0f39b-a30c-4af1-ad6a-1edfd0e24262","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"91B4TyXIsOL3JgsoUTETKCK+fpcKmvfhwJcO55+rWes="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"925fedc4-f6a9-4c0e-a875-4cf482cc8aa6","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"riMso3+lA19Aw1/+yp4PM6WbpAPspE0UbqTEPVwu5ZE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e40db355-6a4e-476d-ac5a-64c0a2a24bf0","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"DhS7z5idBejfqHEiLFH9v4M92J8JuRjNB/sF4mzh8mI="}},"text":"7.3. Distribution of detections by source\r\nDistribution of detections by sourcemetric determines to what extent \r\nthe development efforts of a SOC can contribute to the detection of \r\nsecurity incidents. On a practical level, if a large portion of detections \r\noriginates from the native capabilities of the technologies in use, the \r\ndetection engineering function may not be able to provide additional \r\nvalue in the form of new monitoring rules. The metric can be tied to \r\na specific function, which is responsible for creating custom analytics \r\nwithin the SOC. The metric results are somewhat dependent on third \r\nparties, as the technologies selected to protect the environment have an \r\nimpact on the metric results. However, as the fundamental purpose is \r\nto compare the custom capabilities against the native capabilities, the \r\nmetric is not dependent on third parties but rather influenced by them, \r\nmaking the metric pass the requirement.

Model validation\r\nMetrics are evaluated within a SOC that provides managed SOC \r\nservices to large and medium enterprises. The metrics are judged by \r\nevaluation criteria: “Can the measurements required to construct the met-\r\nric be collected within the SOC used as the test subject?”. The demonstration of metrics with live data could also have been a \r\nvalid evaluation metric for the metrics, but due to the metrics requiring \r\nhistorical data to provide information other than a snapshot of the cur-\r\nrent state, the evaluation would require a longer period to be properly \r\nevaluated. In this research, the metrics have been tested with simulated \r\ndata during the creation process and the expectation is that the metrics \r\nbehave similarly when real-world measurements are used as a source \r\nfor the metrics. Before implementing the metrics, it is necessary to understand \r\nwhich measurements are required to construct the metrics and whether \r\nthey can be collected or not. Out of the metrics generated, the metrics \r\nthat were determined to be valid were distribution of detections among the \r\nunified kill chain, distribution of detections by source, and technical accu-\r\nracy of the analysis. The metric number of verifiable monitoring ruleswas \r\nconsidered to be invalid by the criteria defined by the metric creation \r\nframework. The following section briefly discusses the measurements \r\nfor the metrics that are considered to be valid. The SOC is utilizing a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Re-\r\nsponse (SOAR) platform to manage the security incident management \r\nworkflows. In this particular SOC, the SOAR platform collects all detec-\r\ntions into a single pane of glass in the form of cases, which unifies the \r\nanalyst workflows across different environments and security products. The SOAR platform also produces a significant portion of the measure-\r\nments needed to construct metrics used to measure the performance of \r\nthe SOC. Detections have MITRE ATT&CK tactic classification, which means \r\nthat the MITRE ATT&CK tactic can be successfully utilized in multiple \r\nmetrics.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gIiBp+SZjDtEncp5+sRxhCVyF2y3KKWWpPDbARGk22o="},"01c6f942-50ca-444c-9f76-30504098e65a":{"id_":"01c6f942-50ca-444c-9f76-30504098e65a","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_11","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"8YE6Vcf+VxsQViTuFBJuSrcEwkDLiObOLJdVtDdW5Q8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4d0de4a1-0c35-4ab4-8ec8-faa32970584f","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"gIiBp+SZjDtEncp5+sRxhCVyF2y3KKWWpPDbARGk22o="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e9e00458-1d9f-4d8a-baee-1e73599f06f9","metadata":{"page_number":11,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"dTMrig5PhIVZvmwnEKBGqusYEVZseVbtJEsJS/MKTIc="}},"text":"Furthermore, as the UKC is closely associated with the MITRE \r\nATT&CK framework, the UKC stage can be partially derived from the \r\nMITRE ATT&CK tactic.

All detections and resulting se-\r\ncurity incidents are classified on a high level either as false-positive, \r\ntrue-positive, or benign true-positive.

The decision to limit the number of iterations \r\nwas made due to constraints related to the research schedule and the \r\nfact that to properly evaluate the metrics, they would require years of \r\nmeasurements to be collected. Although the artifact was able to produce metrics that can be used \r\nto enhance the reporting capabilities of the technical performance of \r\na SOC, the link between the technical performance and the metric \r\ncreation framework could have been slightly more concrete. The frame-\r\nwork itself does not directly enforce the relationship between the met-\r\nrics and technical performance. This does not necessarily make the \r\ncriteria to be less useful, but it leaves the determination of whether \r\nthe resulting metric measures technical performance or not up to the \r\nuser of the artifact to decide. As an upside, the framework can also be \r\nused to create non-technical metrics. The literature review did not establish a clear pattern when it comes \r\nto the availability of SOC-related metrics, and as such, a conclusion \r\nwas reached that no such framework currently exists. Many of the more \r\ncommonly used metrics as summarized in Table1are operative, such as \r\nnumber of security incidents, mean time to reactionand mean time to reso-\r\nlution. As a result, they cannot be directly used to measure the technical \r\nperformance of a SOC. Although it could be argued that the technical \r\nperformance has a direct impact on the operational performance and \r\nas such, the operative metrics are also an indication of the technical \r\nperformance. However, as the operational metrics are also influenced \r\nby the process and people aspects of SOC, the metrics provide incon-\r\nclusive results when attempting to be used to measure the technical \r\nperformance. Some of the metrics can be used to partially measure the technical \r\nperformance, such as the false-positive rateor number of incidents handled \r\nautomatically, but they are at best imperfect when evaluated with the \r\nmetric creation framework, due to lack of additional context that causes \r\nthe metric to become overly biased. For example, a high true-positive \r\nrate, and subsequently a low false-positive rate, can be an indication of a \r\nwell-performing SOC but without understanding the detection strategy \r\nor level of automation, the metric alone can be misleading. The SOC \r\ncould automatically close a majority of the false-positive and benign \r\ntrue-positive detections, and instead use them for threat hunting or to \r\nprovide additional context in the form of potentially related low-fidelity \r\ndetections when investigating high-severity detections.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"OYwKIvqwJ9z2F6+lM6k3fcP8cbF1OdHeyZlV29Zf9Mc="},"88b81337-200c-40db-8adf-8d60d9e197c7":{"id_":"88b81337-200c-40db-8adf-8d60d9e197c7","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf_12","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"mKhGcDhen9ggk13dgx8VpYnfe8w/g2ppYwGgWeivi9E="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10a6966c-8b8e-4d37-8b47-870314c04116","metadata":{"page_number":12,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf","file_name":"Technical performance metrics of a security operations center.pdf"},"hash":"OYwKIvqwJ9z2F6+lM6k3fcP8cbF1OdHeyZlV29Zf9Mc="}},"text":"The framework \r\ncan be used to enhance the reporting capabilities provided by these \r\ntechnical metrics, as it can be used to reduce both the bias and subjec-\r\ntivity as well as take into account the additional contextual information \r\nrequired to properly interpret the metric.

However, \r\nwhen examined in light of the developed metric creation framework, \r\nthese metrics were found to benefit from additional context to be more \r\neffectively utilized. As a part of the demonstration of the artifact, four unique metrics \r\nwere created. Three of the four metrics were considered valid in terms \r\nof the metric creation framework.

One of the key limitations of this study is the relatively narrow se-\r\nlection of metrics that were used to demonstrate the framework. The \r\nmetrics created with the framework are mostly related to the detection \r\ncapabilities of the SOC, and other functions, such as threat hunting or \r\ncyber threat intelligence, have not been included in the metrics chosen \r\nfor the demonstration. Therefore, whether the framework is suitable \r\nfor creating technical metrics for functions other than those that work \r\nclosely with the security incident management process remains un-\r\nknown.

This trend has sig-\r\nnificant implications for how Security Operations Centers\r\n(SOCs) manage these end devices on  their enterprise net-\r\nworks: in their organizational roles, regulatory environment,\r\nand required skills. By intersecting historical analysis (start-\r\ning in the 1970s) and ethnography (analyzed 352 field notes\r\nacross 1,000+ hours in a SOC over 34 months) whilst com-\r\nplementing with quantitative interviews (covering 7 other\r\nSOCs), we uncover causal forces that have pushed network\r\nmanagement toward endpoints. We further highlight the nega-\r\ntive impacts on end user privacy and analyst burnout. As such,\r\nwe assert that SOCs should consider preparing for a continual,\r\nlong-term shift from managing the network perimeter and the\r\nassociated devices to commanding the actual user endpoints\r\nwhile facing potential privacy challenges and more burnout. 1  Introduction\r\nCOVID-19 has caused shifts in patterns of Internet use, with\r\nsome tied to the surge in “work from home” (WFH) users [11]. Survey data suggests that at least 41.8% of Americans par-\r\nticipated in WFH [47], and it is apparent that WFH will be-\r\ncome an integral part of larger organizations in the future [53].

Such client devices can  be, but are not limited\r\nto, laptops, smartphones, tablets, Internet-Of-Things devices,\r\nand even small-scale managed networking devices such as\r\nswitches. These endpoints are Internet-connected devices of\r\nany kind, supplied by the organization or the individual, and\r\nare frequently used for a mix of professional and personal\r\nactivities [1, 86]. Typical functions within endpoint security\r\nmanagement include endpoint inventory, adjusting system\r\nconfigurations, restricting access through content filtering,\r\nand more [18]. To protect not only these endpoints but also\r\nthe organization’s resources, Security Operation Centers tend\r\nto oversee endpoint security management [31]. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are central compo-\r\nnents of modern enterprise networks. Organizations in indus-\r\ntry, government, and academia deploy SOCs to manage their\r\nnetworks, defend against cyber threats, and maintain regula-\r\ntory compliance [109, 113]. SOCs are organized in various\r\nways ranging from a flat structure to hierarchical tiers of ana-\r\nlysts, specialists, and managers [106, 107]. The structure and\r\nscope of the performed activities are mostly determined by\r\nthe organization’s size, services offered to its users, or its do-\r\nmain of activity. Albeit, all SOCs still perform certain core\r\nfunctions: incident management, monitoring and detecting\r\nthreats, security administration, architecture and engineering,\r\nand long-term planning [7, 31, 106, 118]. Just as each enter-\r\nprise network includes unique aspects in its configuration and\r\nlayout, so too are SOC tasks [106] and the maturity-level of a\r\nSOC [117].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"H7x8YsNG2OJB6gTivIZoBgdnE+43UfajB9n9uEth/ik="},"6773bc86-416b-4fef-967b-99d3dcd87649":{"id_":"6773bc86-416b-4fef-967b-99d3dcd87649","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_2","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"iHemk8t5Ihy00bsSOSTRmIsTSdYMh0n6zh4Cu7DdkKM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7f4dc6de-d0c2-4d99-a7b6-9cf20a63d244","metadata":{"page_number":2,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"H7x8YsNG2OJB6gTivIZoBgdnE+43UfajB9n9uEth/ik="}},"text":"Even the names that fall under the broad SOC um-\r\nbrella may be different across organizations e.g., Computer\r\nSecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) [29, 107], Net-\r\nwork Operations Center (NOC) [106], Network and Security\r\nOperations Center (NSOC) [108], Cybersecurity Operations\r\nCenter (CSOC) [48], Security and Compliance Center [106],\r\nManaged Security Service Provider (MSSP) [10], etc. Prior bodies  of  work  studied  SOCs  by  conducting  sur-\r\nveys [31, 101, 103, 118], interviewing analysts [7, 9, 69] or\r\nperforming participant observation [106–109].

Input:Evidence Repositories with keyword list\r\nResult:Endpoint management trajectories\r\ninitialization;\r\nAdd \"endpoint management\" to the keyword list;\r\nwhilekeywords have not been searcheddo\r\nextract a keyword from the list;\r\nsearch the evidence sources with the keyword;\r\nifdocument context matches the keyword, is the\r\nfirst instance within our repository sources, and is\r\nrelevant to SOCs and endpoint management,then\r\nextract relevant events and record the included\r\nfundamentally new technologies by usage;\r\nextract contextual keywords from the events;\r\nfilter contextual keywords by leveraging\r\nNGRAMs to understand their\r\npertinence/long-term scalability;\r\nifcontextual keywords are pertinent and we\r\nhave not encountered its root-cause within\r\nendpoint managementthen\r\nadd the contextual keywords;\r\nend\r\nend\r\nremove the keyword from the list;\r\nend\r\ncompile the list of technologies, group them into\r\nperiods by usage and root-cause;\r\nAlgorithm 1:Overview of the historical analysis method-\r\nology. We start searching for keywords with the evidence\r\nsources listed in Section 3.1. As we locate pertinent doc-\r\numents, we  extract common  contextual keywords  and\r\nrepeat the searches until no keywords remain. We finish\r\nby identifying periods of endpoint security management\r\nbased upon technological usage. Evidence Sources: Our evidence draws on primary sources:\r\ndocumentary and born-digital data, with clear provenance\r\nlinking it to the event in question, and subject to minimal\r\nediting  or  commentary. Inasmuch  as  possible, we  avoid\r\nless reliable sources of evidence, such as firsthand accounts\r\nand other forms of after-the-fact recollections.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"BCBNBXoPJJtSLALmXdXk9TgVMLoSb85g+0Opxi4R50g="},"3aecf280-f45b-4282-8cb1-20df7d54b8f7":{"id_":"3aecf280-f45b-4282-8cb1-20df7d54b8f7","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_3","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"ZjMWhtWAzLCGlL5lh+ClPgtqsT5L4NrGuL0sqKD4w/g="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a8621271-a595-4103-869c-6baa4222a573","metadata":{"page_number":3,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"BCBNBXoPJJtSLALmXdXk9TgVMLoSb85g+0Opxi4R50g="}},"text":"Our searched\r\nrepositories  include  Request  For Comments  (RFC)  docu-\r\nments [27], ACM and IEEE digital libraries [5, 59], Defense\r\nTechnical Information Center (specifically the defense agency\r\nnewsletters) [36], UCLA University Archives Special Col-\r\nlections [116], reference manuals that focus on the historical\r\nusage of tools [38], history-focused and formally published\r\nbooks (e.g.,  [2, 20, 24]), Charles Babbage Institute collec-\r\ntion [84], National Archives [81], and, more broadly, other\r\nprofessional societies’ publication archives (often mediated\r\nby Google Scholar).

identified through historical analysis. To confirm and generalize our findings, qualitative interviews with the\r\nSOC employees were conducted whilst pairing a quantitative interview (survey) with seven other SOCs. History Museum [30]), which provide certainty as to a piece\r\nof evidence’s providence. As shown in Algorithm 1, we begin\r\nthe historical analysis with these listed sources. Keywords and Filtering: This line of historical inquiry in-\r\ncludes better-known phenomena and events, such as, the emer-\r\ngence of the Security Operations Center. We focus on histori-\r\ncal trends in the monitoring and management of networked,\r\nlocal host machines, or endpoints by first searching for the\r\nphrase \"endpoint management\" and working backwards in\r\ntime from the first account of \"endpoint management\" to the\r\nfirst known instance of securing endpoints. Next, we explain\r\nthese trends by revealing their origins in (1) broad functional\r\nrequirements that arise from a combination of the network and\r\nhost architectures, and (2) the scale, kinds, and geographic\r\ndistribution of use. In other words, we look for fundamental\r\nchanges to endpoints that would negatively impact endpoint\r\nsecurity management during that era. After analyzing the re-\r\nsulting documents, we continue to extract common phrases\r\nused under the context contained within multiple selected\r\ntexts (e.g., \"NOC\", \"SOC\", \"content handling\", \"acceptable\r\nuse policies\"). As our terminology expanded, our inquiry led\r\nus to phenomena that, while uncontroversial, fall outside of\r\nthe usual scope of Internet history. Such phenomena include\r\nthe basic security practices of 1970s and 1980s campus and\r\noffice computer labs, such as \"keycard locks\" and \"antivirus\r\nsoftware\". We select accounts which were professionally ref-\r\nereed, and which appear (retrospectively against the historical\r\nrecord) to reflect standard or increasingly standard practices.

These insights allow us to better understand\r\nthe pressures and challenges faced by a real-world SOC. For 34 months (June 10, 2019 to May 16, 2022), one field-\r\nworker was embedded within our observed SOC to collect\r\nfield notes.

Embedded\r\n7.80±2.06 hours a week for a total of 1,000+ hours, our\r\nfieldworker recorded their observations based on over 500\r\nemployee discussions.

The first itera-\r\ntion, open coding, involves parsing the field notes to identify\r\ninsights and uncover potential phenomena by labelling ob-\r\nservations known as codes throughout the documents. After\r\nidentifying our codes, we performed axial coding which con-\r\nsists of combining the previous codes from open coding into\r\nlarger themes.

Detailed in Section 3.1, our goal is to understand the historical\r\ntrajectory of endpoint control based on causal links to present-\r\nday SOCs (not a complete global history). The Early Operational Arpanet (1972-1979): The Arpanet\r\nnetwork layer consisted of a network of packet-switching In-\r\nterface Message Processors which implemented a distributed\r\nrouting algorithm and error correction [76]. Outside of a small\r\nnumber of secured networks for classified work [112], net-\r\nwork security was largely based around endpoint’s regulated\r\nphysical spaces [37, 38]. Overall the DARPA-led ecosystem\r\nof researchers and contractors exercised multiple forms of\r\nendpoint control. Basically, each site required access control\r\nmeasures—physical or software-based—to ensure only autho-\r\nrized users and, crucially, authorized use. While there were no\r\ntechnical or organizational mechanisms for content handling\r\nas defined today, content was nonethelessmanagedby regulat-\r\ning use of the systems and the identity of the users [34, 35, 42].

The DCA\r\nfurther developed its requirements for organizational manage-\r\nment of endpoints and added centralized access control to the\r\ndial-in points [44]. Meanwhile, PCs began replacing terminal\r\nrooms and computer service centers [24]. All of these changes differentiated the network edge be-\r\nyond a smaller number of highly managed and physically con-\r\ntrolled machines. To account for the fragmentation, DARPA\r\ndirected the implementation of the Domain Name System\r\nresulting in a new set of regulations and organizational re-\r\nquirements [105]: local security policies to prohibit misuse\r\nand to ensure proper technical configuration [89, 90]. The\r\nlocal computing facilities connected to this network, how-\r\never, remained largely the same. Excluding sites with strict\r\ninformation security (e.g. government classification), com-\r\nputer labs and centers enforced “acceptable use” through both\r\norganizational and technical means [2, 82].

Although network encryption was introduced in\r\n1970s, we see the phrase \"endpoint encryption\" termed during\r\nthis time [37,51]. Smartphones and tablets furthered this trend\r\nwhilst also increasing mobility [121]. The Google NGRAM\r\nresults for “Work From Home” increase gradually during the\r\npost-war US (1945 - 1970s), with significant growth in the\r\n1980s, and spike dramatically in 1998-99 [52]. Externally, the\r\nInternet spread to include individual, institutional, and nation-\r\nstate adversaries, not only with attacks on networks and end\r\ndevices, but also on users (i.e., social engineering) [23]. This period is one of integration and further automation\r\nof NOC/SOCs, and the second half of this period sees their\r\nincreasing ability to monitor and manage end devices. Mid-\r\ndleware such as firewalls—and their increasing integration\r\ninto other tools—responded to the growing threats outside\r\nthe enterprise network [8]. Cloud computing permitted new\r\nforms of network architecture, management, and flexibility\r\n(e.g. Software Defined Networking), as well as easier han-\r\ndling of content intended for end devices (e.g. email, web\r\nlinks) [54, 70].

Thus, we\r\nsuggest thatany present-day expansion of largely technical\r\nendpoint control mechanisms reflects one period in a longer\r\nseries of changes that predate COVID-19. Endpoint management is carried out through a mix of or-\r\nganizational and technological means. These organizational\r\nmeans are simply the structured (or programmed) human ac-\r\ntivity necessary to operate complex technical systems (e.g.,\r\nin-person lab monitoring and ticketing systems). In the histori-\r\ncal scholarship, these organizational means are less prominent,\r\nbecause we suggest that they are not classified as important in-\r\nnovations or technological accomplishments – many of these\r\norganizational mechanisms predate even the Arpanet [91]. We interpret this history to suggest that the organizationally\r\ninstituted endpoint management techniquesworked, in part\r\nbecause they managed simpler systems with fewer threats. When organizational techniques became too labor-intensive\r\nor lost effectiveness due to the changing contexts, administra-\r\ntors turned to technological solutions, and thus to a drive to\r\nautomate. Through Internet history, endpoint management un-\r\nderwent a process of automation, whereby manual tasks were\r\npartially replaced with combinations of digital computation\r\nand (likely fewer, and perhaps different) manual tasks. As the endpoints moved beyond the domain of local orga-\r\nnizational control–either in new distributed forms through-\r\nout an organization, or completely outside the organization\r\nitself–the effectiveness of organizational management tech-\r\nniques for endpoint systemsmust havedeclined dramatically. This decline, in turn, triggered technological solutions, or re-\r\nplacements, for these formerly manual tasks (i.e., automation). Given resource constraints in the contexts under study, we\r\nassume that investments from the enterprise network’s man-\r\nagement, who oversees operation and security, were made\r\nout of necessity. We argue that the widespread nature of the\r\nchanges documented here further rules out highly localized,\r\ncultural, or irrational causes in general–and instead points\r\nto shared organizational and technological solutions to chal-\r\nlenges posed by the changing technical and use environment. 5  Ethnographic Analysis of a SOC in the U.S. In this section, we discuss our discoveries from studying a\r\nhierarchical-structured U.S. SOC securing over 30,000 users.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2Ngb9Q2QEj2azLMf354rDdmUjc+DYMNTfZm9w1Mto2Q="},"87cf2c03-af53-4bf4-b872-6e5ceddf6c7f":{"id_":"87cf2c03-af53-4bf4-b872-6e5ceddf6c7f","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_8","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"CBpvqmDgZG0n5mduLkiLrVMxWTEmU3TW3bpLh0s54+0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d3b39e3d-a5a2-4f13-9f7d-6d9068797719","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"2Ngb9Q2QEj2azLMf354rDdmUjc+DYMNTfZm9w1Mto2Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5b084dd1-2c49-4968-93cf-2607a6d0ac1b","metadata":{"page_number":8,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"Yh8t0tYWw9cDF+31WRdznqhV4T+L57bOeHBeZUseUkA="}},"text":"SOC securing over 30,000 users.

SOC was forced to temporarily oversee these security-related\r\noperations in addition to the SOC’s current tasks. To summarize, the SOC balanced increasing the cybersecu-\r\nrity tools’ capacity and overseeing additional security tasks\r\nwhilst the organization demanded more of their time. Monitoring (Mid-Late March 2020): To ensure the organi-\r\nzation can still operate, both users and employees who did\r\nnot have an organization-owned device were offered one, thus\r\nthe number of deployed endpoints increased. However, the\r\nanalysts quickly highlighted the dangers of this such as doc-\r\numenting the device inventory going home with end users. Notably, P5 expressed their concerns regarding device inven-\r\ntory,“I’m concerned about endpoint monitoring and endpoint\r\npatching. I want to know what was taken off-campus and if\r\neveryone told the correct personnel to keep track of inventory. ”\r\nThis concern’s motivation comes from (1) how the physical\r\nnetwork location is an important indicator for threat detection,\r\nand (2) if new security-related technology needs to be in-\r\nstalled on these endpoints, the SOC needs to determine which\r\nendpoints currently do or do not have that protection. “It doesn’t do any good to provide security on campus\r\nwhen there isn’t anyone there anymore.”(P2) Aside from the\r\nincreased endpoints, yet a lack of device inventory, the ana-\r\nlysts were also concerned with the decreased transparency of\r\ntheir endpoints’ actions. Within our SOC, there was a heavy\r\nreliance upon the firewall and network access points for net-\r\nwork transparency. However, all of these devices shifted from\r\nleveraging the campus’ physical access points protected by\r\nfirewalls to leveraging home or public networks. In other\r\nwords, the origin of network traffic moved from mainly in-\r\nbound to outbound, meaning they were no longer covered by\r\nthe organization’s firewall. Although a virtual private network\r\n(VPN) will route traffic behind the firewall, not all users in-\r\nstalled, or use the SOC-controlled VPN. As P4 pointed out,\r\n“we just don’t have visibility on what endpoints are doing”\r\nwhich P2, P3, and P5 all agreed.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2GcDr2dlEsXN1Nd74RX8roJ37QS1ni103k0+jXVDfrk="},"e713d2bf-2211-4f2a-8b35-7cd7005c799a":{"id_":"e713d2bf-2211-4f2a-8b35-7cd7005c799a","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_9","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"vp0+34PhT1gz4X2xtsxy8DegTKZ/Tg2gyg80kx3biYU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5e9eae40-9f00-4ab9-a2b0-b72cf72b726c","metadata":{"page_number":9,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"2GcDr2dlEsXN1Nd74RX8roJ37QS1ni103k0+jXVDfrk="}},"text":"With an increase in external endpoints (i.e., devices not\r\nleveraging the organization’s network) but a decrease in se-\r\ncurity coverage (i.e., firewall doesn’t apply to non-VPN traf-\r\nfic), the  responsibility of the  SOC  to  protect devices  was\r\nstrained. This was particularly evident when another simi-\r\nlarly structured organization was targeted by ransomware. As P5 fearfully expressed,“the news out of [organization’s]\r\nransomware attack is dire.”and P2 shared this concerned sen-\r\ntiment. This ransomware exploits unpatched vulnerabilities,\r\ntargets user accounts and performs spear-phishing attacks. Securing these vectors requires endpoint patching and mon-\r\nitoring incoming emails [110]. This attack was particularly\r\nmotivating for the SOC not only because of the attack’s suc-\r\ncess as P5 shows,“... 1) It seems likely it’s Netwalker, which\r\nis the same ransomware that hit [an organization]. 2) They\r\nactually paid”, but in addition, it highlights the lack of end-\r\npoint management in which the SOC is no exception:“We\r\nalso need to assume that personal devices are a serious threat\r\nhere since we cannot enforce any kind of controls over them\r\nwith our current toolset. I believe [vendor] has tools we can\r\npush out via the VPN client which would help but is not a\r\nperfect solution since not everyone is using the VPN.”(P5). In other words, personal devices located on the end user’s\r\npersonal network pose a large problem to work computers. On top of the issues directly facing the SOC, the organi-\r\nzation imposed changes upon all the departments that con-\r\ntradicted with the SOC’s needs. During WFH, a few projects\r\ncould impact end users such as moving email inboxes into\r\nthe cloud, automatically installing client-side software for\r\nincreased security, or deploying self-phishing exercises. At-\r\ntempting to continue these efforts posed a risk of disrupting\r\nthe organization’s end users, thus these projects were tem-\r\nporarily suspended. This means that all of IT temporarily\r\npaused projects to allow users to adjust to WFH which con-\r\nflicted with the SOC’s attempt to re-establish better security\r\ntools in hopes to increase transparency.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IQ0SRH4JyRCVnHe/TvOYzdgY/j0606XJY8HPRA3b3jw="},"4e2204c5-03ee-4261-93d1-dbd42b22a25c":{"id_":"4e2204c5-03ee-4261-93d1-dbd42b22a25c","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"0znh3DeTow0YJ/Xg+7BTJUyw6P2w4ynpWjsaL/AAuuo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3b1aac8c-e84e-48bc-9324-c9cf74ac8872","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"JPT3407EaoIcgIEsXOG+qH381m7rVQlkAYlEuwhjlno="}},"text":"Suspicious Emails Reported by Users     Counts     Percentage\r\nLegitimate Emails                                    1,964        8.6%\r\nMalicious - Non COVID-19                     19,819      87.5%\r\nMalicious - COVID-19                            880           3.9%\r\nTotal                                                         22,647      100%\r\nTable 3:  Statistics of COVID-19’s impact on incoming, un-\r\nblocked emails from January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022.

Short-Term Response (April-July 2020):  Another prior-\r\nity, labor-wise, was an increased effort on monitoring and\r\nmanaging malicious emails. In particular, the organization\r\nexperienced an influx of malicious emails taking advantage of\r\nthe pandemic which coincides with SIEMplify’s survey [101]. Because these emails contained terminology/text specific to\r\nCOVID-19, the SOC released public communication reports\r\nwhich (P5) helped develop,“are there any other COVID-19\r\nemails you could forward to me? I’m working up a memo”. These experiences paired with public articles highlighting\r\nrecent COVID-19 scams (i.e., one manager requested a corre-\r\nlation between a public dataset and the organization’s email\r\ndataset), increased the priority of monitoring incoming emails\r\nand resulted in a new script to calculate the distribution of\r\nemails specific to COVID-19. Attackers also filed fraudulent\r\nunemployment claims that affected organization’s employ-\r\nees who would forward those emails to the SOC. These two\r\nevents increased the SOC’s pressure on monitoring emails. The SOC employs two main techniques when stopping\r\nthese types of attacks (blocking malicious URLs and pulling\r\nemails from inboxes). Thus, we wanted to better quantify\r\nthe impact on  COVID-19 related emails. We numerically\r\nanalyzed malicious COVID-19 emailsreporteddirectly to\r\nthe SOC between January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2022 as\r\nseen in Table 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tQOjFnURIGHPC9dlpBi+Yg9UWPCM/3pP6PrSwGvlMKM="},"3b1aac8c-e84e-48bc-9324-c9cf74ac8872":{"id_":"3b1aac8c-e84e-48bc-9324-c9cf74ac8872","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_10","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"0znh3DeTow0YJ/Xg+7BTJUyw6P2w4ynpWjsaL/AAuuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4e2204c5-03ee-4261-93d1-dbd42b22a25c","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"tQOjFnURIGHPC9dlpBi+Yg9UWPCM/3pP6PrSwGvlMKM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e4b5719f-47c4-4fd8-919c-1ef7d1ca7aed","metadata":{"page_number":10,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"SpfvfqBzG3pJjISUnpObxKv55Gr083jQC4v3sCU0Iuw="}},"text":"Out of the 22,647 reported emails during\r\nthis duration, 19,819 emails were malicious with 880 of those\r\nmalicious emails mentioning COVID-19 within the content. Protecting users from email is not the SOC’s only moti-\r\nvation. The SOC also wanted to proactively protect the end-\r\npoints’ applications. Additional controls are required to in-\r\ncrease endpoint protection, but the SOC’s pre-WFH security\r\nsolutions were no longer sufficient. To address this short-\r\ncoming, the SOC focused on re-tuning applications such as\r\nZoom [123]. The SOC required adjustments to Zoom across\r\nall users such as pushing out updates and mandating security\r\nsettings for all users,“FYI the Zoom changes went through\r\nlast night. Password required on all Zoom meetings after\r\nthe change (this can’t be shut off) and caller ID masking\r\nis enabled for dial in users”(P5). For a clearer understand-\r\ning, we calculated the number of times an article covering\r\nZoom vulnerabilities was shared amongst the team. Between\r\nMarch 15th and December 31st of 2020, the SOC shared 220\r\nURLs  containing  various  security information  with 14  of\r\nthese URLs discussing the latest Zoom vulnerabilities. Aside from reconfiguring applications, the SOC focused on\r\ntheir current cybersecurity toolset and adjusted technical set-\r\ntings particularly within the anti-virus application: increasing\r\npassword complexity requirements (i.e., credential protec-\r\ntion), preventing certain applications from executing through\r\nthe preexisting anti-virus, and privilege escalation prevention. Not only are these controls similar to endpoint protection, but\r\nthey also protect against data loss stemming from the user,\r\nwhich in turn protects the organization from compromised\r\nuser accounts [77, 102, 115, 119]. To further prevent data loss,\r\nthe SOC restricted certain types of device applications as\r\ndeemed suspicious by the software (e.g., patch level, device\r\nbehavior etc).

We define SOC\r\ncontent handling as actions taken to prevent users from ac-\r\ncessing the organizations’ resources based upon the content’s\r\nsemantic meaning. In this case, the SOC is looking at the\r\nsemantic-meaning of data passed through the network. Conditional access is another technique used to protect\r\nthe organization by restricting endpoints. In this work, we\r\ndefine conditional access as the action to restrict endpoint’s\r\naccess to specified resources typically based upon semantic\r\ninformation. The SOC attended training webinars and tested\r\nin-place applications that could potentially limit user’s ac-\r\ncess to software applications and data. In order to implement\r\nconditional access, analysts determine high-risk features and\r\nprevent certain devices with those identified features from\r\nobtaining important resources. For example, one discussion\r\nrevolved around preventing devices running end-of-life Win-\r\ndows 7 from accessing cloud-based storage. Even though these changes are motivated with good inten-\r\ntions (e.g., protect the organization from threat actors), we\r\nnoted a decrease in end-user’s right to privacy. User devices\r\nare not restricted to organizational use and in fact, can be\r\nused for personal matters. With these new tools, the SOC\r\nanalysts could now leverage more of the individual user’s\r\nactivity as these tools correlate directly to the user rather than\r\naggregated network traffic during pre-WFH. For example,\r\nour SOC primarily monitored endpoints’ traffic within the\r\nnetwork perimeter. Under the regular operating procedure,\r\ndevices were isolated or blocked from the enterprise network\r\nwhen suspicious network traffic to and/or from those devices\r\nwas detected. Once a device was blocked, its user/users and\r\nthe corresponding network administrator were identified and\r\nthen notified.Only then, depending on the type of compro-\r\nmise and the involved user account(s), the SOC accessed the\r\ndevice and analyzed information directly on that endpoint. With no or very limited network traffic to serve as a warrant\r\nfor identifying malicious behavior during WFH, the SOC had\r\nto compensate for the lack of visibility by relying on a contin-\r\nuous access to endpoint devices that monitor very detailed and\r\nin-depth system behavior, system contents, and user activity\r\n(similar to a constant search without a warrant/preliminary\r\nindicator).

It appears that thebiggest de-\r\ntermination towards decreased endpoint transparency lies\r\nwithin SOCs who have a mostly local, centralized workforce. SOCs did not report decreased transparency if they (1) could\r\nbe defined as a Managed Security Service Provider or (2)\r\nworked with a highly distributed user base. We found that\r\nCOVID-19 affected projects, and of the six affected partici-\r\npants, three participants explicitly reported projects pausing\r\ndue to reprioritization. Four participants experienced projects\r\ndropping, progressing slower, but also progressing faster.

Based on our\r\nethnographic methods, we identified our SOC’s trajectory\r\nchange from maturing (e.g., training staff, configuring SIEMs,\r\nautomating redundant tasks) to solely deploying and config-\r\nuring automated endpoint security management tools. The semi-structured interviews contributed to confirming\r\nthat the motivation of this shift was COVID-19’s WFH phe-\r\nnomena. Lastly, based on our surveys, other SOCs with a local,\r\ncentralized workforce were similarly affected and worked to-\r\nwards improved endpoint security. With these findings, we\r\nsuggest that this pushreflects an intensified periodof end-\r\npoint security management. Furthermore, we note that even\r\nthough BYOD previously brought very similar challenges,\r\nmany current endpoint security tools are costly, thus we also\r\nsuggest this intensified period forced many lagging SOCs to,\r\nmore permanently, invest into endpoint security [19]. A Regulatory Environment for SOCs: While the organi-\r\nzational management of endpoints  is  old, SOCs  and their\r\npredecessors have, traditionally, used their technology to man-\r\nage network components, not endpoints. This has spared them\r\nfrom some of the legal and social issues that arise when se-\r\nmantically richcontentis handled (e.g., end user browsing\r\nbehavior) [122]. We believe that this turn to endpoint control\r\nis extremely significant insofar as SOCs come to be expected\r\nor seen as a site of content-aware monitoring. With locally-\r\ninstalled applications on computers used for professional and\r\npotentially for personal use, not only does transparency in-\r\ncrease but also the level of control a SOC can apply to these\r\ndevices such as blocking URLs to websites, removing emails\r\nfrom inboxes, or opening well-known ports for better access. Content monitoring is more easily drawn into culture wars\r\nand could even spark calls for regulation [20]. Based on our\r\nstudy, we believe SOCs must cautiously proceed with tech-\r\nnical actions and consider the sociotechnical aspect behind\r\nimplementing endpoint security management. Another Stimulus of Burnout:  After the initial shock of\r\nCOVID-19, a lot of pressures continued to weigh on the SOC\r\nanalysts.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7hZRvIpT1lHfNdQ2K62GoxR1+bvoxI8IHeO2IoDbM3Q="},"158a9472-46a4-45ab-9979-de88c7a532f8":{"id_":"158a9472-46a4-45ab-9979-de88c7a532f8","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"BOz7bpAUpuLzX1yDoBrX7zPLh/PAU6RpY/a0xXW3dOU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d1433ef5-ec7e-4099-9248-5a591a528773","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"7hZRvIpT1lHfNdQ2K62GoxR1+bvoxI8IHeO2IoDbM3Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"503feaea-b1d8-400f-be3a-cb7cc8a35648","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"M56vHrtFNvEOlzSTj+MhCZlOoWikuZjIGVf2d5Q3oZM="}},"text":"We saw organization budget cuts resulting in a re-\r\nduced salary across all SOC employees, restrictions upon\r\nadopting new (proprietary) security-oriented tools, a drop\r\nin training opportunities, and incidents over vacation days. Corroborated with various external events (e.g., [6] vulnera-\r\nbility, [39]), these factors weighed heavily in the decision of\r\nSOC personnel to leave their jobs. Action Item 1 - Device coverage: Lack of transparency was\r\nprominent during COVID-19’s WFH yet transparency is an\r\nimportant factor in securing systems [43]. Our case study SOC\r\nwas able to reconfigure, re-purpose and integrate existing ser-\r\nvices into operations whilst recognizing their remaining ineffi-\r\nciencies. However, with such a distributed network boundary,\r\nendpoint security management focused tools may still not be\r\nenough to protect resources. Rather than control all endpoints\r\nfrom a network-focused perspective, a Zero Trust perspective\r\nmay be more appropriate. Specifically, SOCs should already\r\nassume devices are compromised. This allows SOCs to focus\r\nmore upon enforcing controls tailored to critical threats (e.g.,\r\nlateral movement, data breaches etc. ) rather than protecting all\r\nendpoints [95]. Our SOC and its parent organization started\r\ndedicating resources to enabling such a shift. Action Item 2 - Tracking time for training: Although a Zero-\r\nTrust-oriented effort may be warranted, we note that this ap-\r\nproach requires processes, technology, and people to imple-\r\nment [95]. As we found through participant observation and\r\ninterviews, many pressures during COVID-19 led to burnout,\r\nand these needed resources may not be available to SOCs. Thus, we also propose that SOCs should track time spend\r\non training. Many SOCs may have quickly adopted endpoint\r\nsecurity management yet may have failed to provide training\r\n- particularly towards user-device monitoring challenges (e.g.,\r\ncontinuous browsing history to user attribution). We believe\r\nthis will help realign SOCs towards increasing maturity. Action Item 3 - Documentation and data needs: Managing\r\ncomplex controls in modern endpoint management systems\r\ncan be burdensome [73]. Thus, SOCs should ensure that re-\r\nstrictions upon semantic content are strictly security-related\r\nrather than motivated by other factors. We believe this can be\r\naccomplished by documenting policies surrounding the expec-\r\ntations of end user privacy.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Ic5TV0BzvBO1mqmoJkoihhMRTfJxYs9Gn1R0U3gf7rI="},"503feaea-b1d8-400f-be3a-cb7cc8a35648":{"id_":"503feaea-b1d8-400f-be3a-cb7cc8a35648","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_13","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"BOz7bpAUpuLzX1yDoBrX7zPLh/PAU6RpY/a0xXW3dOU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"158a9472-46a4-45ab-9979-de88c7a532f8","metadata":{"page_number":13,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"Ic5TV0BzvBO1mqmoJkoihhMRTfJxYs9Gn1R0U3gf7rI="}},"text":"We also believe that these policies\r\ncan  help the  SOC  formulate  their precise  data  needs  and\r\nin turn potentially reduce user-device content-aware-related\r\nchallenges. Our studied SOC has recognized these challenges\r\nas permanent, especially since the new monitoring tools and\r\nthe reconfigured tools aimed at increasing visibility on end-\r\npoints during COVID’s WFH became part of their everyday\r\nalert handling process. Moreover, even if most of the organi-\r\nzation returned back to an in-person, in-office mode, there are\r\nsome groups that were reorganized into a permanent WFH\r\nmode.

To begin addressing this new climate, SOCs\r\ncould start by assessing specific data needs from their end-\r\npoints as well as documenting processes for accountability.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"M56vHrtFNvEOlzSTj+MhCZlOoWikuZjIGVf2d5Q3oZM="},"724224c9-50c7-4fd9-b467-167395c35e5d":{"id_":"724224c9-50c7-4fd9-b467-167395c35e5d","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_14","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"wBwoaPuYoKa6JIMMhuZkKw+gYpsq10JjBuq6EnWZun4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5fe1011e-8e7b-4212-af33-efb77882cde8","metadata":{"page_number":14,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"jbRT0qdzaCBIcVyVmHp3mtMFsp1XTUWCxaVQIiN/nFY="}},"text":"Acknowledgements\r\nWe are grateful to all of our collaborators in this work and to\r\nour anonymous shepherd and reviewers for their thoughtful\r\nand constructive comments, which vastly improved this paper.

This section is focused\r\non providing additional details about the initial involved en-\r\ntities such as ARPA/DARPA and DCA. Moreover, Table 5\r\ncaptures the list of keywords resulting from our historical\r\nanalysis methodology. The Early Operational Arpanet (1972-1979): The US Ad-\r\nvanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) became the De-\r\nfense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972,\r\nwith a brief 1993-96 return to ARPA [32]. ARPA began its\r\nlife as a four-node testbed in 1969, and reached basic func-\r\ntionality by late 1972 with working host software for common\r\noperating systems, remote login (telnet), file transfer (FTP),\r\nelectronic mail (SNDMSG and CPYNET) and the formal role\r\nof the Network Control Center (NCC) [2, 76, 87]. However,\r\nend systems were often shared mainframe systems [76]. Out-\r\nside of limited TCP/IP experiments, LAN endpoints directly\r\nconnected to a local Arpanet host, and were not nameable or\r\naddressable on the Arpanet itself [4, 66]. Bolt Beranek Newman  (BBN), the contractor that built\r\nthe subnetwork and operated it through its Network Control\r\nCenter (NCC; the direct predecessor to the Network Oper-\r\nations  Center), knew the  topology through a  combination\r\nof manual and technical means that were increasingly auto-\r\nmated over time [41]. The NCC could disconnect any host\r\nif it caused problems for the network [74, 75]. In 1975 the\r\nDefense Communications Agency (DCA, current DISA) in-\r\ntroduced formal rules for local management of end systems,\r\nwhich were implemented by a “network liaison” at each site\r\nfor all Arpanet-connected systems [34, 35, 42], all coordinated\r\nthrough another DARPA contractor, the Stanford Research\r\nInstitute (SRI) and its Network Information Center (NIC).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/V6v6V0BKvy/NFgI7+C1ZEkjx8L+5gvJB6l4zmpmhk8="},"52a4cc74-ed50-4b36-9108-dbaded9e2c79":{"id_":"52a4cc74-ed50-4b36-9108-dbaded9e2c79","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_16","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"4Vgi5Y8cv53+ALZwvCK9fxIYIYYBcwJ8FVXPcoR2ac0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"689a7960-8072-4eea-81e9-13af8328ff65","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"/V6v6V0BKvy/NFgI7+C1ZEkjx8L+5gvJB6l4zmpmhk8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"98152310-cb48-4945-9433-506ee273612c","metadata":{"page_number":16,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"nuzo7koefM5+6sB5hcOB0CgIPuONw6ouoBxjVjCi9gU="}},"text":"The ARPA Internet (1980-1986): The Arpanet served as the\r\nmain testbed for the TCP/IP suite from the mid-late 1970s, and\r\nbecame the Internet’s backbone from 1983-86 (the Arpanet’s\r\nlast nodes were decommissioned in 1990) [96]. The Arpanet\r\nera  also  initiated the  Internet’s  globally unique  addresses\r\nmapped to network interfaces [97], an open application layer,\r\nglobal name mapping to addresses [2, 120], end-to-end cryp-\r\ntography [37], Local Area Networks [67], and new routing\r\ndemands [40] (it garnered the name “ARPA Internet” [93] in\r\nsome official documentation). The Arpanet also served as a\r\ntemplate for other networks [120]. The NSFNET Before Privatization (1986-1990): A wave of\r\nautomation hit network monitoring with the spread of Sim-\r\nple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP)  and Hewlett-\r\nPackard’s first Network Node Manager (NNM), HP Open-\r\nView, both developed from the late 1980s [25, 94]. Triggered\r\nby the explosion in network size, complexity, and use, SNMP-\r\nbased NNMs automated basic network monitoring and control\r\ntasks. This automation, in turn, permitted further division of\r\nlabor between more and less skilled analysts. This process,\r\nas well as ticketing systems to help organize hierarchical\r\nwork, became especially visible in the late 1980s [58, 61, 65]. It also permitted more automated management of heteroge-\r\nneous networks, with new protocols such as Asynchronous\r\nTransfer Mode (ATM) and Multiprotocol Label Switching\r\n(MPLS) now in widespread use for and between enterprise\r\nnetworks [80]. A.2  Additional Field Notes Statistics\r\nAs detailed in Section 3.2, for 34 months (June 10, 2019 to\r\nMay 16, 2022), we embedded one fieldworker to collect field\r\nnotes.

Due to our\r\nunique perspective, these field notes contain rich, longitudinal\r\ndescriptions of the studied SOC environment and, therefore,\r\nare our main source of ethnographic data. During this study, we analyzed 352 field notes where 57 of\r\nthe field notes are from 2019, 121 field notes are from 2020,\r\n131 are from 2021, and 43 are from 2022. These field notes\r\ncover over 1,000 hours of the analyst embedded in the SOC\r\nand contain observations from more than 550 SOC meetings. A.3  Semi-Structured Interviews\r\nOur   interviews   intend   to   validate   or   invalidate   our\r\nthemes/findings resulting from the Grounded Theory Method\r\n(GTM). When interviewing, we used a list of questions as a\r\nguide and did not ask each question in order nor did we cover\r\nall of them in each interview depending on the time. Table 8 captures our list of questions. Prior to starting the\r\ninterview, we forwarded the questions to each interviewee and\r\nclarified that they may either interview live (face-to-face) or\r\nwrite their answers. Upon interviewing, we reiterated that each\r\nquestion is voluntary. Furthermore, we did not record video\r\nor audio rather the interviewer (our fieldworker) took notes\r\nand typed participants’ quotes during the interview process. When an employee asked for something to be removed or not\r\nexplicitly stated, the interviewer removed or stopped writing\r\nand continued when instructed to do thus. Since the SOC we studied is short staffed, and with the\r\nincreased pressure from multiple facets, the lack of resources\r\nprevents this SOC (at times) from covering their daily oper-\r\nations, troubleshooting unique cases, learning new tools in\r\nlight of WFH, and proactively preventing new attacks. This\r\nincludes the ability to participate in interviews and surveys.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"nuzo7koefM5+6sB5hcOB0CgIPuONw6ouoBxjVjCi9gU="},"3545d9a6-4cee-415b-ba98-25bdfcdd9564":{"id_":"3545d9a6-4cee-415b-ba98-25bdfcdd9564","metadata":{"page_number":17,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf_17","metadata":{"page_number":17,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"+7msXPi00gFpHKZgpDXD4pz0ysCOYgxZp4PSTodp8u8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1fab0ab4-0176-4a9c-b74f-8e769d5fb6f0","metadata":{"page_number":17,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\Wisnuyasha\\Documents\\kuliah\\semester6\\project\\backend\\data\\Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf","file_name":"Work-From-Home and COVID-19 - Trajectories of Endpoint Security Management in a Security Operations Center.pdf"},"hash":"8bEd9h3Fne/hUGnpu7EghRXNaAJE7NVsUmQZv2jbZg4="}},"text":"Research WorksKeywordsEra\r\n[4,34,35,37,38,41,\r\n42, 66, 74–76, 112]\r\nArpanet, NOC, network control, secure facility, secure access, electromagnetic shield\r\n(physical security), access control policies, regulating network access, controlling\r\nremote access, authentication, management control\r\n1972-1979\r\n[2,24,40,44,56,82,\r\n89, 90, 93, 96, 105]\r\nARPA-Internet, Defense Communications Agency, host naming, scalable, central-\r\nized access, policies and procedures\r\n1980-1986\r\n[2,15,24,26,33,45,\r\n82, 83, 98, 99]\r\nNSFNET, distributed network, nodes, anti-virus, permissions, host monitoring, re-\r\nformat, quarantine, network encipherment, acceptable use policies, distrust, identity\r\nmanagement, security policies\r\n1986-1990\r\n[12–14, 17, 25, 28,\r\n41,58,61,62,65,68,\r\n71, 80, 85, 92, 94]\r\nOpenView management, private sector, scale, growth, network isolation, access\r\ncontrols, user behavior, surveillance, inventory management, video security cameras,\r\nphysical security box, ID badges, updating software, viruses, automation, anti-virus,\r\nresponsible use policies, ethics, privacy concerns, middleware\r\n1991-1999\r\n[8,23,37,46,54,70,\r\n88, 100, 111, 121]\r\nSDN, IP security, endpoint encryption, network security, reputation management\r\nsystems, phishing, fraud, sandbox\r\n2000-2019\r\nTable 5: Historical Analysis Works – Keywords resulting from our historical analysis methodology.

RoundsSemi-Structured Interview Questions\r\nFirstRound\r\nSecondRound\r\n1.How do you feel about the level of work since COVID-19 started? When WFH started? 2.Has your level of responsibility increased, decreased, or stayed the same? 3.How is the communication amongst the team? With other departments? 4.Have priorities shifted since WFH? How so? If priorities have shifted, did it make sense as to why this occurred? 5.How has productivity been since WFH happened? Based on the current environment, what change might help improve your productivity? 6.Do the current tools support WFH? Would a certain feature provide more help? 7.What would you say is the big weakness of the SOC with WFH? How do you think this should be addressed? 1.One of the priorities during the initial transition to WFH was endpoint management (i.e., leveraging [organization’s tool] to apply better \r\nsecurity policies). What initially motivated this change? After altering the policies within [organization’s tool], are you content with this \r\nimplementation? 2.Previously, most of these machines were behind the campus firewall, now a lot of them are on external networks. Have you evaluated the \r\nexposure due to the remote management systems? For instance, the new [organization’s tool] system is opening up hosts quite a bit so that \r\nIT staff can connect to these hosts. 3.With the shifts to remotely manage devices, has accountability been considered? Specifically, who has access to and management privilege \r\non these remote machines? A few management accounts with admin privileges are shared by IT staff. 4.Another transition I noticed was an increased discussion of data loss prevention techniques and how those can be implemented by the \r\ncurrent solutions and services. Was this similarly motivated with endpoint management? Table 8: Semi-Structured interview questions – We conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews within our SOC. During\r\nthe first round, we focused on analysts’ perceptions; whereas, the second round revolved around themes obtained through GTM.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dXqYnD32tyGxP12BQM/AdliXwGYCuYQKZ2PGENouri8="}},"type":"simple_dict"}}}
